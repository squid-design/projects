Yeast ferments the sugars in the wort into ethanol and carbon dioxide via anaerobic respiration. They also produce secondary metabolites that add to the flavor of the beer. There are many different strains of yeast, all of which will impart different characteristics to the beer other than ethanol and carbon dioxide production.

Yeast should be stored in cool temperatures around 2-4&deg;C (35-40&deg;F). It is also important to store them for as little time as possible.

There are two major types of yeast: top fermenting yeast and bottom fermenting yeast. Top fermenting yeast is commonly referred to as ale yeast and bottom fermenting yeast as lager yeast. In addition to these two major types, there are thousands of different strains that all “impart” their own character onto the beer.

Bacterial contamination and wild yeast can also greatly affect the fermentation and final product. Sometimes wild yeast and bacteria are purposely introduced to make sour ales, however most of the time they are accidently introduced and result in off-flavors.

#### Selecting Yeast
When selecting yeast for their beer, there are several factors that brewers take into account. Yeast strains have their own unique ester profile, flocculation properties, alcohol tolerance, stress tolerance, storage characteristics, mutation stability, and attenuation rates. All of these factors need to be taken into account when selecting a particular yeast strain to produce a particular type of beer.

Attenuation rates of the yeast strain utilized can greatly impact the flavor and mouth feel of the beer produced. The attenuation process is essentially the conversion of sweet wort into beer through the yeast’s metabolic activity. The rate and degree to which this happens can greatly impact the flavor profile of the beer. Yeast with relatively low attenuation rates create sweeter beer, with residual sweetness left on the palate. Yeast with relatively high attenuation rates creates a very clean and dry beer.

In addition to attenuation rates, yeast flocculation properties can have a profound impact on the beer-making process. Flocculation is a process marked by the aggregation of yeast cells such that clusters of them sink to the bottom of the fermenter. Some yeast have the ability to do this better than others. Yeast that are particularly poor flocculating can lead to beer loss during the yeast removal process. It can also impart a “yeasty” flavor in a beer, which can be a flaw in some beers and a defining aspect in others. By this, yeast selection is an incredibly important part of brewing beer.

<tr>
<td>English Yeast</td>
<td>Create high levels of esters and some strains create moderate levels of diacetyl</td>
<td>Malt-forward flavor profiles with notes of fruit and butterscotch</td>

<td>Belgian Yeast</td>
<td>Create a flavor flavor profile very unique to belgian beers.  Result in many different ester and phenols</td>
<td>Create fruity banana and cheery-like notes and sometimes leaves a peppery finish.</td>

<tr>
<td>German Wheat Yeast</td>
<td>These yeast strains stay suspended in beer giving it a cloudy appearance. They generate many esters and phenols which drive the flavor profile of the German wheat beer.</td>
<td>Largely fruit driven with notes of banana and cloves</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>American Ale Yeast</td>
<td>Produce relatively low levels of phenols and esters.</td>
<td>Leaves a clean finish in the mounth and often results in lager-like beers.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Brettanomyces</td>
<td>Commonly thought of a wild yeast; however, it can be commercially bought and can create many appealing flavors.</td>
<td>Creates predominately fruit-driven beer with notes of cherry and pineapple. However some strains can have negative flavors such as leather and barnyard-like notes.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Acetobacter</td>
<td>Generate acetic acid</td>
<td>Result in sharp and often acrid vinegar notes. However, in small quantities, these flavors can bring out a pleasant sourness in a beer</td>

  From a quality control standpoint, the greatest risk to yeast is the introduction of wild yeast and bacteria. Wild yeast and bacteria have ample adverse effects such as fermentation retardation and the addition of off-putting flavors and toxins. There are limited solutions to combating contaminated yeast, but acid washing is one partial solution. Acid washing yeast will help reduce the number of bacteria found in yeast, but it will not help reduce the wild yeast.

#### Recommendations
- Acid wash yeast if wild yeast and/or bacteria adversely affect fermentation

- Store yeast under cold conditions and utilize promptly
