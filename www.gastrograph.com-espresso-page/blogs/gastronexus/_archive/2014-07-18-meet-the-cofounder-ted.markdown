**What type of work do you do for Gastrograph?**

Because we're a relatively small startup, we all take a lot of different roles. My main position is the Lead Developer, but I still jump around a lot to sales, marketing, and account managing.

As the Lead Developer, I oversee and manage the technical pipeline. We have teams working on Android, iOS, DevOps, and Web. I don't necessarily work on every project, but I do make sure everyone understands what direction to move in and keep projects on track.

My main development roles are in Android and DevOps. I build a lot of the features for Android and design the structure of the code base. I enjoy DevOps the most though because I love building systems that simplify our lives and the customers' lives.

I have also recently started working hard on outbound sales. It's a very unique experience for me because it activates an entirely different part of my mind than my engineering work.

**What sparked your interest in working in that field?**

For the pure engineering aspect of my work, I largely attribute my interest to both my degree program in Computer Engineering and being around tech my whole life. My father has run an IT Networking, Integration, & Managed Services company (Promenet, Inc.) for 14 years. I was always involved with the organization, so it became an engrained interest for me.

**Why did you choose AFS?**

I chose AFS because it fit my culture and work ethic perfectly, and the team is composed of some of the best people I know.

My interests and culture fit the company and I immediately hit it off with my other co-founders. I switched into Computer Engineering (from Architectural Engineering) and began programming in August of 2012. I had been eating entirely organic for a few years, and enjoyed a few high quality artisan products, but I wasn't truly exposed to them. In February 2012, I met Jason and John, and began work on AFS -- I was able to pair my love of programming with my love of high quality artisan goods.

Once we began working together, I learned how to taste through daily tastings and began work on the tech stack (AWS) on the weekends. Over the length of the company, we've held a few short "Hacker House periods" where we all lived and worked together. This truly was the "startup life" and I loved every second of it. Our work was and still is very intense, unlike any experience I would otherwise have been exposed to.

Building AFS and being in a startup has allowed me to grow as a developer very rapidly. I went from very little notion of what a computer system is to managing a team of awesome developers that build enterprise technology. I chose AFS because of the environment I work in and the people I work with. I couldn't have asked for a better place to grow as a person, entrepreneur, and developer.

**Gastrograph has a pretty unique environment.  What would you say your favorite part is?**

Living and working together with my whole company. It allows us to grow as a group and grow in the same way. We're incredibly productive and know each other very personally; I live and work with 11 of my close friends.

**You get to evaluate many different drinks.  What product is your favorite to taste test?**

Beer

**Why is that?**

For a few reasons: I feel like it is an easier product to review, I love the taste, and there is a lot of flavor complexity in each beer.

**Working at a startup can be time consuming.  What activities do you do in your free time to alleviate the stress?**

Brazillian jiu-jitsu is one of my favorite ways. I've been training in the gi (think kimono) for about 8 months and have competed a few times at the white belt level. It helps me exercise my competitive side which carries over really well to my work activities (mainly trying to win customers).

Reading is also one of my favorite leisure activities. I enjoy philosophy a lot, mostly metaphysics; my favorite philosopher is Arthur Schopenhauer. But I'll read anything that I either find intrinsically interesting or that I think will benefit me intellectually. Right now I'm working through *War and Peace*.

I also focus on activities that help me gather my thoughts and relax my mind. My favorite two things to do for that are meditation and long solitary walks.

But, most of my free time on the weekends is spent with my family and girlfriend. Those relationships are the most important thing to me, so I always attend to them first.

**What would you choose as your last meal?**

If I knew I was going to die in a few short hours or days, I would not want anything to eat. I think there is a lot of value in fasting and the effects it has on the mind. I would want to be as conscious as possible and eliminate as many worldly thoughts as I can. That short period of time will produce thoughts and emotions so rare and positive that I would want to experience them as fully as possible. Although I can't take that experience with me after death, I see no other way to enjoy my last moments any fuller.

**If you were given a free full-page ad in the newspaper and had to sell yourself in six words or less, how would the ad read?**

I'm extreme in everything I do.
