In my previous blog post, I discussed the importance of oxygen in beer wort before and during primary fermentation. Generally, beer wort is so rich in nutrients and minerals that the yeast will thrive as long as primary fermentation is sufficiently aerated and fermented at proper temperatures. However, in mead, honey is the source of fermentable sugars, and it greatly differs from malted grains.

Honey is a supersaturated sugar solution that is notable for its antioxidant and antimicrobial properties. This is why medieval meadists openly fermented the mead must with wild yeast without an overwhelming threat of infection or spoilage. However, for the modern meadist, the complexities of honey have many effects on how yeast ferments the must. Let’s examine to see how the various types of carbohydrates and other macromolecules affect the fermentation process.

####Sugar in Honey
Honey is an incredible, natural product that comes from nectar collected by bees. Beekeepers most often produce single-flower honey such as clover and wildflower. Different flowers produce nectars that have very distinct flavors, but all single-flower honeys contain roughly the same amount of carbohydrates.

As seen in **Table 1**, the types of carbohydrates in honey are primarily fructose and glucose, which are very easy to metabolize for yeast.  About 1% of honey consists of the dissacharide sucrose, which needs to be broken down into one glucose and one fructose molecule before being metabolized. Furthermore, 7% of honey consists of oligosaccharides, attributed to to glycoproteins within the honey. These oligosaccharides were found to play important roles as prebiotic candidates, which are sources of food for beneficial bacteria that are in an organism’s microbiota. One of these probiotics include *Lactobaccilli*, which lends itself to be prone to *Lactobacillus* infection.<sup href="#2">2</sup> However, the risk factor of infection is still very low.

Therefore, yeast cells do not face many issues when it comes to metabolizing a majority of the carbohydrates. Glucose and fructose enter yeast cells through facilitated diffusion, in which, solutes are transported into the cell, down a concentration gradient, without requiring ATP.<sup href="#2">2</sup>

Since transport occurs through the plasma membrane and cell wall, it is of utmost importance to maintain yeast health to prevent stuck fermentations, and in order to ensure resilient plasma membranes and cell walls, yeast need sufficient vitamins and minerals. Honey then becomes a problematic food source then, because although rich in fermentable monosaccharides, honey also lacks several growth nutrients, most notably free amino nitrogen (FAN).<sup href="#3">3</sup>

####A Lack of FAN
Low levels of free amino nitrogen (FAN) and other required vitamins and minerals are not news to experienced meadists. In fact many of them use variations of the same strategy to combat this issue. However, it’s equally important to understand why these strategies are used from a molecular viewpoint. As the yeast population makes the transition from growth to fermentation, its health requirements change to include the sugar, vitamins, and minerals from the must to conduct its metabolism.

Yeast require a multitude of vitamins (i.e. niacin, pantothenate, thiamine), but most importantly it needs biotin to maintain protein levels. Biotin plays a major role in most biosynthesis processes, including protein, nucleic acid, and fatty acid synthesis and carbohydrate metabolism. The observed poor growth and damaged plasma membranes are attributed to biotin deficiency. Reed and Nagodawithana document biotin levels in average beer wort of .56 μg/100 ml. Levels in undiluted honey were previously observed at .066 μg/100 g, which would represent three to four times the levels found in a honey must.<sup>4,5</sup>

Many of these micronutrients are utilized in the process of transamination, in which amino acids are broken down and reassembled by the cell to build the lipid layers in the plasma membrane. A strong, healthy plasma membrane is vital for various mechanisms of sugar transport into the yeast. Nitrogen is also a metabolic need, and during fermentation, nitrogen is used by transporters that move sugars across the plasma membrane against a concentration gradient. Glucose uptake is also controlled under certain physiological conditions by an irreversible inactivation of the transporters. Upon exhaustion of the nitrogen source in the medium, activity of glucose transport decreases to a value of about 20% of the initial level.<sup>2</sup> Ultimately, this puts the yeast at risk for stuck fermentation.

####The Home Meadist Strategy
The lack of nutrients in honey is well known to meadists, but now we understand why these nutrients are important in general yeast health and in the fermentation process. Homebrewers have taken on a universally-accepted technique called staggered nutrient additions (SNA) to combat poor yeast health and/or stuck fermentation. Products such as yeast nutrients and yeast energizers are used in this method which introduce vital nutrients to the must to maintain healthy yeast population with scheduled additions throughout the first few days of primary fermentation. A step-by-step guide for SNA can be found in this Homebrewers Association’s <a href="http://www.homebrewersassociation.org/how-to-brew/improve-mead-staggered-nutrient-additions/">article</a>.
