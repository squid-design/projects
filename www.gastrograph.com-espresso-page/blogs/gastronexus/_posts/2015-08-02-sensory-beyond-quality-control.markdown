**The following is an excerpt from a guest post written by Ryan Ahn and Steve Wang on The Brewer Magazine's Supplier Insights section:**

Almost all breweries run a final quality check on their beer before shipping it out, but in each part of the brewing process lies the possibility of the unexpected. Setbacks such as diacetyl and acetaldehyde contaminants are going to appear in various parts of the brewing process. Assessing the final productâ€™s quality is always going to be critical, but is there anything that can be gained from sensory analysis during production?

Imagine QC checking a post-production batch both in the lab and with sensory only to find out that that the flaw detected could have been remedied or prevented earlier during production. Imagine that same batch was bound to be flawed from an issue that occurred prior to wort preparation and could not be remedied.  At what critical control points during the brewing process do you decide to either cut your losses and dump the batch or move forward with a flaw mitigation technique? Why take a chance on the time, energy, and resources of fermenting that batch if early detection is at your disposal?
