**What type of work do you do for Gastrograph?**

As the lead designer, I pretty much deal with anything related to appearance and the overall aesthetic of the company. I love the wide range of opportunities that presents.

**What sparked your interest in working in that field?**

I've been into art since I was a child and finished my degree in New Media.

**Why did you choose AFS?**

AFS sort of gradually chose me- I began redesigning the logos in my free time just for fun, and then the allure of artisan products roped me in, until I wanted to design not only for myself, but for the success of the company.

**Gastrograph has a pretty unique environment. What would you say your favorite part is?**

The constant growth as a person and of knowledge is definitely unique to working in a startup. Being surrounded by so many different fields of expertise is so enriching and exciting!

**You get to evaluate many different drinks. What product is your favorite to taste test?**

It's a close call between coffee, sour beers, or gin. Overall, I'd have to say coffee.

**Why is that?**

I have a special interest in brewing techniques, and I enjoy the variation you can achieve from preparing coffee in different ways. In this case, I have a lot of control over how the final review turns out.

**Working at a startup can be time consuming. What activities do you do in your free time to alleviate the stress?**

I practice Japanese tea ceremony and any art that I can. This immediately helps me find my calm place and leaves me feeling invigorated to take on more problem solving at work.


**What would you choose as your last meal?**

An enormous plate of fresh sashimi.

**If you were given a free full-page ad in the newspaper and had to sell yourself in six words or less, how would the ad read?**

Innovative **S**.uper **Q**.uick **U**.ser **I**.nterface **D**.esigner.
