Making beer is not a walk in the park. Countless hours go into each and every batch to craft a final product that you would be proud to share with your favorite customer. Sometimes, though, time and effort are not enough to ensure a good brew. Contaminations, unforeseen fermentation problems, and many other pre- and post-production problems are difficult to predict and variation between batches is inherent. Nonetheless the ultimate goal is a consistent, high quality product. The means to this solution is quality control.

Analytical Flavor Systems (AFS) defines quality control as taking the necessary measures to ensure a well-crafted consistent product. It is taking time, energy, and resources and putting them to work to make educated, effective, and efficient actions to take control of a product.

### Quality Control in Craft Beer
Beer can suffer from problems introduced by the raw ingredients, mistakes that occur during wort preparation, problems from the ample biological processes that occur during fermentation, bad packaging, mishandling, and inadequate storage conditions among many others. In short, achieving a consistent and quality product in the artisan brewing industry is incredibly difficult.

There are many factors that make up a high quality product. Beer color, clarity, foam, and, most importantly, taste, all play into a consumerâ€™s perceived quality of a product. Therefore, optimizing these parameters and keeping them consistent should be at the forefront of quality control measures.

This series will go over the various elements of raw ingredients that can cause issues with Quality Control.
