      <h4>Overview</h4>
      <p>The Gastrograph System offers a wealth of information and resources to producers within the artisan beverage industry. With the analysis and power to determine flavor profiles, alert you of a contaminated batch, flaws, or taints; Gastrograph provides a long-term solution for product quality. This guide will walk you through your first employee tasting. It is best if you read this prior to the tasting and keep it nearby to reference during the tasting.</p>
      <p>If you haven't already scheduled a date to conduct a tasting, you can do so <a href="https://producerpanel.gastrograph.com/demo">here</a>.
      <p>The first step is to select a product to review.  We recommend picking a regularly produced product. Your more unique or seasonal products might need more than a single review session to understand the underlying chemical structure.</p>

      <h4>Application</h4>
      <p>After selecting your product and assembling a panel of individuals to review, it is now time to conduct a tasting panel and receive your customized product analysis.</p>
      <p>The first step in this process is to download the Gastrograph Review App.  The mobile app was designed to allow the easy input of your review data into the Gastrograph cloud. You can find links to both Android and iPhone Applications to the right. Please ensure everyone on the panel has downloaded the application.</p>
      <p>We recommend that everyone on your panel read the <a href="/learn/how-to-review.html">"How To Review"</a> guide. After downloading, each member of the panel is required to create an account and select the type of product to be reviewed.  The Gastrograph System will adapt to each user based on how they taste regularly and be able to flag reviews based on this.</p>

      <h4>The Panel</h4>
      <p>Begin by filling out the Product Info page as a group. The Product Info defines your product, including the name of the producer (Your company), product name, batch number and more. The current Android Gastrograph App allows the sharing of Product Info; however, the current version of the iOS App does not have this feature. Future versions of the app will incorporate this feature and more.</p>
      <p>Once all Product Info has been entered, you can dispense your selected product amongst the panel and start your review.  Wait to discuss the review until after everyone has completed it. You can print out our <a href="/learn/how-to-review.html">"How To Review"</a> guide to reference during the review. It should take roughly 10 minutes to conduct your first review.  The more you review with the Gastrograph System, the easier it gets.</p>
      <p>After everyone tastes the product, the Gastrograph should be filled in. Upon completion, a Perceived Quality Score should be assigned. The data is sent to the Cloud where it is processed. The initial set of reviews may require up to an hour to analyze and create your FREE report.  A subscribed account, will take less than 5 minutes.</p>
