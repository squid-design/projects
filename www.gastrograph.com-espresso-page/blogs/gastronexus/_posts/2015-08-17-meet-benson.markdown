**What type of work do you do for Gastrograph?**

I am a biochemist for the chemistry team.

**What sparked your interest in working in that field?**

I am amazed by the huge impact by tiny critters, especially by yeast. Having worked with yeast in studying stochastic gene expression as an undergraduate, it made a lot of sense to work with the same critters in a field that is deeply rooted in modern American culture.

**Why did you choose AFS?**

Having lived in State College for four years, I’ve finally learned to love central Pennsylvania as my home, so it’s great that I have a reason to stay. More importantly: beer, coffee, and biochemistry. Like, why not?

**Gastrograph has a pretty unique environment. What would you say your favorite part is?**

I’ve only moved into the Hacker House two days ago, so I’m still settling in and familiarizing myself with the way-of-life here. So far, I’ve drunk a lot of coffee before starting any work so I’d say that’s my favorite part.

**You get to evaluate many different drinks. What product is your favorite to taste test?**

Coffee is the most aromatic drink, maybe even more than red wine (don’t quote me on that). When cupping coffee, every sip or slurp will unveil a different flavor and aroma. The complexities of brewed coffee is absolutely incredible. As for my favorite product to taste, it’d have to be Stumptown’s Ethiopian Yirgacheffe Chelbessa.

**Working at a startup can be time consuming. What activities do you do in your free time to alleviate the stress?**

I like to go for bike rides. I’ve got my hybrid for longer rides on trails and my fixie for rides downtown. It’s refreshing and doesn’t strain your brain. If the weather’s bad, playing guitar is a good way to relieve stress and also feel productive.

**What would you choose as your last meal?**

Falafel with a side of honeydew.
