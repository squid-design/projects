**What type of work do you do for Gastrograph?**

Data science and business development.

**What sparked your interest in working in that field?**

I started by focusing on the development of the Gastrograph system when it was still a research project at The Tea Institute at Penn State.
I wanted to find a way to really measure what people were tasting and how the flavors of ageing tea changed over time.

Now I work mostly on business development, sales, and our data science back-end. I still ship code to production every day.
Recently, our data science team has grown from one person (just me) to Arturo, a few of our developers, and two interns - so I've been spending a lot of time training them in our current techniques and the techniques we will implement in the future.

**Why did you choose AFS?**

I didn't. AFS chose me.

**Analytical Flavor Systems has a pretty unique environment.  What would you say your favorite part is?**

I love helping craft producers who want to expand, but are serious about maintaining quality.
I love our 5+ tastings a day and helping catch and identify flaws - I'd rather have my team catch it then let it ship and hurt a producer's chances of success.


**Working at a startup can be time consuming.  What activities do you do in your free time to alleviate the stress?**

I roll jiu-jitsu twice a week and rock climb on weekends.
Every time I get stressed about work, I think about my hardest moments climbing and it keeps me grounded.
Work's not going to kill me.


**If you were given a free full-page ad in the newspaper and had to sell yourself in six words or less, how would the ad read?**

Trained palate needs artisan products.

 **Strangest Tasting Exigence:**

 Either wasp larvae in Yunnan (China) or homemade absinthe at a New Years warehouse party in Brooklyn.
