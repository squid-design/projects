One of the most important conditions that needs to be controlled during the process of brewing beer is temperature.  Temperature should be monitored and controlled during each step of brewing from mashing in, to fermentation, and even in packaging, distribution and aging.  Temperature is a major factor in many chemical processes that take place during the production beer.

The next few sections will go over how temperature affects the resulting beer during mashing, wort separation, fermentation, and finally packaging, distribution and aging.

####Mashing and Wort Separation
Mashing in is the process by which grains and malt are added to hot water in order to extract fermentable sugars.  This process is highly dependent on temperature.  If the mixture is too cool the starches will not be extracted or converted to sugars by enzymes.  If the temperature is too high an unpleasant flavor evolves due to burning of grains in the mash.  The mash temperature also plays a role in the foam stability of the finished beer.

Two things happen during mashing to make fermentable sugars available to turn into alcohol.  The hot water dissolves starches from the grains and pulls them out of the grain and into solution.  Enzymes already found in grains break these unusable starches down into usable sugars.  The temperature range in which extraction happens is very large. The higher the temperature is, the more starch will be extracted.  If temperature is too high, above 77°C (170°F), tannins are extracted from the grains.  These tannins give the beer a harsh bitter flavor.

The enzymatic breakdown of starches is much more temperature specific. There are three main enzymes that break down starches into sugars.  The first, α-amylase, prefers to do its work at 66°C - 72°C (150°F - 160°F).  This enzyme produces many non-fermentable sugars that will give the finished beer more Mouthfeel and less alcohol.  The second enzyme is β-amylase which operates most efficiently in a temperature range of 57°C - 68°C (135°F - 155°F).  β-amylase produces more fermentable sugars, resulting in a drier and more alcoholic beer.  β-glucanase is the third enzyme and operates most efficiently near 45°C (113°F) but will still carry out the enzymatic breakdown of glucans up to 60°C (140°F). Above these temperature ranges the enzymes denature and no longer break down starches to sugars. By varying temperatures between 55°C and 72°C (130°F - 160°F) one can vary the amount of each enzyme thereby changing the flavor of beers even if the mash bill is the same.

Mashing temperature is also important for developing good foam quality in the finished product.  The temperature at which mashing occurs has an impact on what proteins will be in the finished product.  Foam stability is largely dependent on protein and lipid concentrations in the final product.  Most proteins are foam promoters, meaning they make more stable head.  Lipids, on the other hand, can rapidly decrease foam stability.  At temperatures lower than 55°C (130°F) foam promoting proteins such as Protein Z and Lipid Transfer Protein 1 (LTP1) undergo proteolysis (breakdown of proteins) and more lipoxygenase is present.  Lipoxygenase is an enzyme that promotes the formation of fatty acid hyperoxides that destroy foam stability.  As temperature increases, the levels of proteases (protein destroying enzymes) and lipoxygenase decrease and the amounts of foam promoting proteins extracted increase.

In multiple infusion mashes the temperature is purposefully held in lower ranges to promote activity of certain proteases that will break down proteins into smaller proteins which, if done correctly, can increase the body and foam quality of the beer.  By adding grains to the water at temperatures of 50°C-57°C (122°F-134°F) and holding for 20-30 minutes, proteases are activated and foam promoting proteins are created from the breakdown of larger proteins.

Temperature control during mashing is very important.  It ensures that beer will have your desired foam stability, flavor, Mouthfeel, and alcohol levels. Temperature should be kept between 55°C and 72°C (130°F - 160°F).  Varying the temperature within this range will affect the final product also.  The process can be fine-tuned to achieve the desired flavor profile.  Cooler temperatures will result in more fermentable sugars, leading to higher alcohol and lower foam stability.  As temperature is increased the finished beer will have more Mouthfeel, less alcohol, and greater foam stability.

Lautering and sparging are very temperature specific processes.  Before the wort is drained from the grist the temperature of the mash should be raised to a temperature between 75°C-77°C (168°F-170°F).  This allows for maximum saccharide extraction without extracting harsh tannins from the grains.  Sparge water should also be in this temperature range for the same reason: to recover as much fermentable material as possible. The high heat also helps to stop some enzymatic activity.

####Boiling
Temperature control during boiling may seem unimportant.  After all, water only boils at one temperature&emdash;right?  Water may only boil at one temperature but that doesn’t mean that boiling temperatures are unimportant.  During boiling a number of important things happen.  Hop acids are extracted from added hops, enzyme activity is terminated, Maillard reactions take place, and proteins that determine foam stability are affected.

The addition of hops to beer imparts bitter flavors and foam stability.  Usually hops are added during wort boiling.  The temperature and time at which hops are added has a great effect on the final flavor of the beer.  The high temperature of boiling allows for the extraction and isomerization of hop acids (α-acids) and oils as well as the volatilization of hop oils.  Hops added earlier in the boil will boil for about 60 minutes, adding to the bitterness of beer.  This is because α-acids are extracted from these hops and high temperatures cause them to be converted to iso-α-acids.  Hops added in the middle of the boil (boil for 15-30 min) give the beer a crisp “hoppy” flavor.  This is because the α-acids are extracted from the hops but there is not sufficient time to cause them all to convert to bitter iso-α-acids.  The hops added at the end of the boil will impart hoppy flavors and aromas from hop oils that will not be heated for long enough to volatilize and be driven from the beer.

It is also during boiling that most of the Maillard reactions in brewing occur.   Maillard reactions occur between free amino acids and carbohydrates in the wort and result in darkening and flavor changes in the beer.  Maillard reactions cause browning when cooking and are similar to reactions that cause caramelization.  These reactions can add nutty, bread-like, caramel, and toffee notes to beer.  These reactions are highly dependent on the amino acids present, the pH of the wort, and the temperature of the boil.  If any of these factors change, the products of the Maillard reactions will change and impart unexpected flavors to the beer.  With the large amount of variables affecting these reactions, it is difficult to say which temperatures work best. To achieve the most consistent product, temperature should be carefully controlled.

Boiling temperature also has an impact on foam stability.  As the temperature of the boil increases foam stability decreases due to denaturation of foam stabilizing proteins.  At high temperatures there is also a larger difference between the temperature at the top of the wort and the bottom of the wort.  As this temperature difference increases both the flavor of the beer and the foam stability suffer.

To achieve the greatest foam stability, flavor balance, and the best body, the temperature during boiling should be kept as low as possible.  It is difficult to lower the boiling temperature too much, though, because, as stated earlier, the wort will start to boil at a set temperature.  The only way to really decrease the temperature of a boil is to decrease the air pressure over the wort. This is not feasible unless beer is being made at a high altitude.  However, it should be noted that the temperature of a boil should not exceed 102°C (216°F).  Temperature uniformity is also very important; it is wise to invest in a kettle that heats from the sides as well as the bottom.

It is also important to control the temperature of the wort post-boil.  The wort should be cooled as quickly as possible.  At temperatures bove 60°C (140°F), bacterial growth is inhibited.  Below that, bacterial will flourish in the nutrient rich wort.  The wort should be cooled as quickly as possible, ideally 30 minutes or less, to a point below 27°C (80°F).  If the wort takes too long to cool it will promote the growth of bacteria that will ruin the beer.  By using a cooling bath or wort chiller with cold water or glycol coolant, wort can be cooled quickly enough to avoid bacterial growth.  Rapid chilling of the wort also induces cold break where chill haze causing proteins are precipitated out due to the temperature change.

####Fermentation
Yeast is critical to brewing.  Without yeast the fermentation process that turns sugars to alcohols would not occur and there would be no beer.  Yeast have temperature sensitive processes.  If the wort is too cold yeast will not turn sugars into alcohol as effectively and the beer will not have the desired amount of alcohol.  Sweetness from the unconverted sugars will dominate the flavor of the drink.  If the yeast is too hot they will die and similar problems will arise as well as the addition of a yeasty flavor to the beer.  The table below illustrates the response of yeast to different temperature ranges. Of course these numbers vary slightly depending on the type of yeast being used.

The optimal temperature for yeast growth, 30-37°C (86-99°F), is not the optimal temperature for fermentation (with a few exceptions).  At these temperatures the yeast will produce higher molecular weight alcohols and the beer may have a chalky or solvent like flavor.  For most lagers the fermentation temperature should be around 13°C (55°F).  This low fermentation temperature will limit ester production in the beer.  Esters are compounds that impart sweet or fruity flavors.  These low temperatures also cause the buildup of sulfur compounds and diacetyl that cause a myriad of unwanted flavors.  This is rectified by heating the lager to around 21°C (70°F) in the secondary fermentation.  This allows for the undesired compounds to be metabolized by the yeast and/or dissipated through a more rapid production of CO2.

Ales on the other hand ferment better at slightly higher temperatures. Depending on the flavors desired in the beer the temperature for ale fermentations can vary between 18°C and 24°C (64-75°F) and even as high as 32°C (90°F) for saisons, a type of French farmhouse ale.  Higher ale fermentation temperatures around 21-24°C (70-75°F) result in the production of fruity or banana flavored esters.  Lower ale fermentation temperatures (18-21°C or 64-70°F) will result in the production of less of these fruity flavors and more clove flavored esters will be produced.   Temperature control during fermentation is essential to controlling the flavor and overall quality of the final product.

####Packaging and Distribution and Aging
Packaging and distribution are very important to beer quality and flavor.  Also, in most cases, the temperature during distribution is beyond the control of the producer.  As beer ages, different flavors can be imparted.  Some of these flavors are good and some are bad.  Beer that is too old or has gotten warm is often described as stale or cardboard like.  Bitterness tends to decrease, whereas sweet honey or toffee notes increase over time. Other flavors also change with time (shown in Figure 1 below). Aging a beer may be a way to maximize its potential.  However if temperature is not controlled this could go bad quickly.

{% picture post-images post-images/beer-qc/flavor-changes-as-function-of-aging.png "Figure 1 (http://www.brewersassociation.org/attachments/0001/3980/EDP_Quality.pdf)" %}

As beer is being packaged, transported, stored in warehouses, or waiting for purchase in a store, it is aging.  In order for your beer to be as close to the product shipped out as it is when you test it for consistency, it should be kept as cold as possible without freezing.  Regardless of whether the beer will get better with age it should be kept cold to ensure product consistency.  Increased temperature speeds up all of the chemical processes that cause beer to age and eventually spoil.  In Figure 1.5 below it can be seen that the life of a beer increases dramatically as temperature decreases.

{% picture post-images post-images/beer-qc/time-to-age-as-function-of-temperature.png "Figure 1.5 (http://www.brewersassociation.org/attachments/0001/3980/EDP_Quality.pdf)" %}

It is difficult, if not impossible, to control the temperature of a beer while a different company is in charge of shipping it.  While there may be contracts in place to ensure the beer does not reach certain temperatures, it is still possible that these conditions are not met.  How is a brewer to know?  What if there was a system to continuously monitor the temperature of a finished beer from packaging to the store or pub at which it is sold?  Analytical Flavor Systems is currently developing a system to do just that.

If the beer being produced is to be aged, then there are some simple guidelines illustrated in the table below for what temperature to hold them at as they age.  Of course these are not hard and fast and may require some experimentation.  Aging is not required but can be used as a way to bring out desired flavor changes in certain beers. Temperatures higher than those recommended in the table will shorten the lifespan of your beer.  Temperatures lower than that may induce chill hazing.  Some beers simply age better than others; this may be something to consider when deciding how to store beer for aging.

####Conclusion
Controlling temperature when making beer is paramount during every step, from mashing in all the way to distribution and aging.  Temperature can affect the flavor, foam quality, consistency, and longevity of beer.  Fortunately it is also something that, in most steps, is easy to monitor and control.
