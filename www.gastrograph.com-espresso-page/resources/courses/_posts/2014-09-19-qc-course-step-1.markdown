Are you a head of production or quality control? The owner of a company? Someone who cares about the consumer experience? Or a dreamer yearning to make a product you can share with the world?  When you first start producing on a small scale, creating a quality control program probably isn’t the first thing that comes to mind. Before anything else, you'll need to create a product that you love.  It isn't until you begin scaling up production, shipping products, and signing contracts with restaurants or distributors that the need for a consistent, quality, product becomes necessary.

Quality control programs are often ineffective or inefficient because the tests are hard to manage, gather enough data for, and require some knowledge of statistics, spreadsheets, or databases.  Even when quality control problems are found, it’s often too late to pull a batch from distribution, or worse, you find out about a quality control problem from your customers!

This 6-week course is designed to help you go from no quality control program in week 1, to a fully operational quality control program capable of detecting batch variations, flaws, taints, and contaminations in week 6.  Each week covers an actionable step (or two!) that you can implement within your company utilizing resources we have built specifically for artisan producers in your industry.

For the quality control professional, this 6-week course should build on your experience and offer advanced implementation techniques – so you can make better, faster, decisions with the attached resources.

We also include an overview of how [the Gastrograph System][link-science] handles the problems and subtleties of quality control at the end of each course – we hope the Gastrograph System is the right tool for your company, but if it isn’t, this course will still teach you the tools and tests you need to implement an effective quality control program at your company and make a consistently great product.

The most effective quality control programs start with a goal.  A well-defined goal will help you decide the right tests to run, and at what stage of the production process to run them.

Sensory-based quality control programs rely on what people taste.  There are other types of quality control programs such as in-line testing and lab-based testing, which require specialized tools, equipment, and space.  While those programs are often effective, they are expensive to implement, and rarely run at full capacity because of the costs associated with each test.  Sensory based quality control can be run with your current staff in a cost effective manner, and does not require tools, equipment, or dedicated space.  Small-to-medium sized artisan producers are best served by a sensory-based quality control program.

Large artisan producers can utilize a lab based program or in-line testing.  These tests are often faster and more precise for a single flaw or compound than traditional sensory programs, but are not a replacement for a representative population (A few living, breathing, humans) tasting your product.  The human pallet is amazingly sensitive to the four basic flavors, and thousands of aromas (some trained tasters can smell the difference of more than 50,000 compounds).  Most importantly, it’s the variations that humans can taste that you care about.

> The tongue can only taste four basic flavors: sweet, salty, bitter, and umami (the flavor of proteins) - all other flavors are actually aromas entering the sinus cavity via the nose or the mouth. The tongue can also taste Sour and Acidity (all natural acids are sour, all acids are sour) in combination with one of the four basic flavors; the perception of sour compounds is always paired with other flavor attributes.

Furthermore, it is easy to confuse production monitoring with a quality control program; measuring your roast or boil temperature and timing is important and helps improve consistency, but like lab programs and in line testing, production monitoring should not, and cannot, replace the sensitivity and understanding of a well-trained panelist. As an artisan producer, the way you build a brand and following is by creating new, unique and innovative flavor profiles – and then producing them consistently.  Your product starts with a great recipe that you and your customers enjoy or love – if the product doesn’t taste good, quality control won’t save it. Quality control comes after product development and production.

Common examples of testing goals include:

  1. Reducing batch-to-batch variation (**consistency** is the key to building a long-term following)
  2. Catching flaws, taints, or contaminations before shipping a bad batch of product (one bad batch can ruin a brand)
  3. Optimizing preparation and serving parameters for your customers (such as temperature suggestions for beer or brewing methods for coffee)

The best quality control programs focus on factors unique to each product by selecting an individual, measurable, and achievable goal.  It’s OK if multiple products share the same goal (such as reducing batch variation), as long as those goals have been thoughtfully chosen for that product.

Once you have selected the goals for your quality control program, both the production team and quality control team should be informed.  It works best to link the quality control program back to your business goals such as brand growth, increasing repeat purchases, or increasing customer satisfaction.  Linking your quality control program back to business goals gives you and your team a source of outside motivation to make things better for your customers – the ultimate decider of your products quality and success.

###Our method:
The Gastrograph System simplifies your quality control program by providing your team with a consistent method for product reviews, and automating the analysis.  We build statistical models using machine learning and data science techniques capable of finding patterns in what people taste.  Our statistical models can identify both current and future (latent) flaws, taints, and contaminations in products with greater than 95% accuracy – which is over three times more accurate as a quality control professional using standard techniques (and doesn’t require any of the lab equipment, space, or supplies of a lab-based program!).

We will explain more of our science and technology over the next 5 weeks, and you can take a look at our [resources section.][link-learn]
