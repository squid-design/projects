#####Craft Beer is Originality
<blockquote style="margin: 25px 0;">
  <p>"The hallmark of craft beer and craft brewers is innovation. Craft brewers interpret historic styles with unique twists and develop new styles that have no precedent."</p>

Craft beer culture is founded on originality and based on an open-minded community who seek out bold new flavors and new experiences. Craft beer as a whole is growing at a miraculous pace, averaging 12% annualized growth for the last 10 years (*The New Brewer, Vol 32: January/February 2015, Pg 44*) and it's fair to say that this is a true grassroots movement - a movement that's about more than just beer; it is one about individuality, creativity, and relatability.


What is the key to continued growth though? Right now, craft beer represents 11% of all beer sales in the United States. As growth, continues the community is going to be looking at not only market growth, but also market sustainability. How do we continue to grow craft beer not just for the next 10 years, but for the next 100?

#####Macro-beer is Consistency
In a market as competitive as beer, consistency is key. Though some may see Anheuser-Busch InBev as the "enemy", they are clearly doing something right as they have 25% of the global market share.

Do they make good beer? Debatable. Are they consistent? Definitely.

When we ask ourselves what advantages that AB InBev and MillerCoors have over craft beer, there are two distinct competitive edges.

#####Marketing and Product Consistency
As large entities, it's easy for them to spend a lot of money on commercials, billboards, sponsoring events, and anything else you can think of. However, times are changing and everyone, especially the younger generation, are becoming more and more resilient against direct advertising. People question things more and trust must be earned not simply given.

When you look at the consumers of typical American adjunct lagers, it's people who are resistant to change that typically stay with them the longest. Similar to how McDonald's advertises to kids and sells them happy meals, the ads ran by AB/MillerCoors paint a picture of good times and having fun. Craft beer, though, is usually introduced to new people through their friends. I personally used to only drink domestics before being introduced to craft by a friend, and I don't plan on going back, ever. More and more people are realizing how cool the craft beer world is, and this excitement leads to the type of marketing you literally can't buy: word-of-mouth.

Craft beer culture is already turning the corner on the marketing advantage, but what about product consistency?

For the past two years, the Craft Brewers Conference has been pushing for brewers to understand that in this business, it's a matter of when, not if, something will go wrong. Process errors are part of the job, and part of the brewer's job is to implement a rigorous quality control program to guarantee those bad batches never leave the brewery. As a brewer, minimizing the frequency of bad batches goes a long way in competing amid an industry of 3,500 craft breweries and 2,000+ in planning. As an industry, minimizing bad batches goes a longer way in increasing and sustaining a higher market share than just 11%. This is simply just the beginning.

Preventing bad batches is just one part of the quality control process. The batches also need to be consistent like they are at some of the top grossing breweries (AB InBev & MillerCoors). It's quite simple: as humans we love to know what's coming next in life, including what my beer will taste like. Consistency is what keeps customers coming back. Long-term inconsistency is unprofessional and does not build your brand - it tears it down.

#####Balance
Ask any brewer why they originally got into brewing and I bet you very few of them will tell you that it was so they could regulate oxidization and clean tanks. The romanticism of brewing beer for a living is captivating; everybody is trying to create the next big style or the next standout beer within a style. Brewing is neither an art or a science - it is both an art *and* a science.

There are two requirements to making a great beer - creative design and flawless execution. As an industry, especially the smaller brewers, the focus is on creative design. It's more fun to create new recipes and experiment and try to create something that's never been done before. However, I invite you to read a quote from the creative visionary and distinguished Italian product designer Massimo Vignelli.

<blockquote style="margin: 25px 0;">
  <p>"Design without discipline is anarchy, an exercise of irresponsibility."</p>

If Craft Beer wants to reach 20% by 2020, its attitudes toward quality control and product consistency must change. The industry grows every year and we're like a young adult right now. We've left our domestic beer parents, but we're just now learning that not everything they did was evil or wrong; they may have lost their youth, but have gained wisdom in return. Let's take what they do right and make it part of us.

We must maintain our originality but also respect the history and longevity they have achieved. As a collective, craft breweries should be held to higher standards. It's not okay to ship bad batches and inconsistency is simply unacceptable. Pride should be set aside and quality control has to be a priority. Craft Beer is **only** 11% of the domestic beer market right now.

Marketing loses its power more and more each day, but consistency is not a trend. It's a necessity.

It is not a question of originality or consistency, it's the path to achieve both originality **and** consistency.
