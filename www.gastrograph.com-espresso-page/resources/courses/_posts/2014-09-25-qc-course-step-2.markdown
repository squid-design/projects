This 6-week course is designed to help you go from no quality control program in week 1, to an operational quality control program capable of detecting batch variations, flaws, taints, and contaminations, in week 6.  Each week covers an actionable step (or two!) that you can implement within your company- utilizing resources we have built specifically for artisan producers in your industry.

For the quality control professional, this 6-week course should build on your experience and offer advanced implementation techniques so you can make better, faster, decisions with the attached resources.

We also include an overview of how the [Gastrograph System][science] handles the problems and subtleties of quality control at the end of each course – we hope the Gastrograph System is the right tool for your company, but if it isn’t, this course will still teach you the tools and tests you need to implement an effective quality control program at your company and make a consistently great product.

The most effective quality control programs use the right tests to meet their goals.  The right tests will create the results, positive or negative, that you need to measure and improve your products quality and consistency.

After selecting the goal for each product in your quality control program, you need to decide on your tests and tools of sensory evaluation.  The right test will give you the information and insight you need to improve your products quality, consistency, and consumer satisfaction.  The wrong test will leave you guessing about your products’ flavor profile, and can mislead you into tossing a good batch or, even worse, shipping a bad batch.

It is imperative to understand what type of results the test will return, how you will judge those results, and how you will deal with positive and negative outcomes of the test.  If the results of your quality control program are questionable or debatable because the tests don’t match the goals, you don’t have an actionable quality metric – your company must develop its own minimum standards of quality and batch variance, and understand how much variation your customers are willing to accept.

You will need buy-in from ownership, management, or the head of production to pull a batch from distribution or to decide which batch will ship – the purpose and goals of your tests should be communicated with your team before the tests are started so that trust and confidence can be built within your quality control program.

Sensory tests used in quality control programs fall into one of three (3) categories:

* Difference Tests

* Magnitude Estimation

* Descriptive Analysis

Each one of these categories contain numerous possible experimental designs, and each design contains hundreds of possible variations – covering them all would take a 2 semester graduate school seminar in food science.  Instead, we will cover the most common sensory test in each category, their use, and implementation.  Other sensory tests in the same category will follow a similar structure.

Once the tests have been chosen, you will need to set aside enough of each product to run your test on every production run, or at specified intervals.  The product should be randomly pulled from the same batch as you are testing, and should not come uniformly from the top or bottom of the bag or tank.  All products should be served at the same temperature, and each panelist (reviewer) should receive an equal sized portion. Many quality control programs require that each panelist finish the entire portion of the product before responding to the sensory test questions.  In week 6, we will create your own variance checklist and further discuss experimental design.

###Quality Control Tests and Their Implementation

<br>
####Overall Difference Tests

Difference tests can tell you if a statistically significant variation exists between a batch of a product, or two different products. Overall Difference tests are useful as a general test for variation or difference – for example, testing if your new batch of product matches the flavor profile of your previous batch.

>*Warning:* These tests are not designed, nor will they tell you, which flavor-attributes of a product are deviant (if a difference exists). These tests are solely and exclusively designed to detect differences in the overall flavor profile.  Using the overall difference test to measure attribute intensity is a common source of error in quality control programs.

Examples of Overall Difference Tests:

* The Triangle Test

a. *Implementation:* Place 3 samples of your product in front of each panelist:  Two (2) samples from the last OK (not contaminated or deviant) batch, and one (1) sample from the current batch.  Ask them to determine which product is different. Results should be written down by each panelist on a form. The results should be tallied and the forms should be filed away.

b. *Results:* The results of a triangle test are a percentage of correct and incorrect responses. Lower percentages of correct responses equate to a lower probability of a statistically significant deviation.

c. *Problems:* This test is good for flagging batch variations, but cannot tell you *why* a batch is deviant, or *which* specific flaw, taint, or contamination it contains.  Furthermore, difference testing suffers from pallet-fatigue, cross contamination, and high data requirements.  Additionally, the results of these tests cannot be historically analyzed to show a trend, and it is nearly impossible to remove variation caused by tasting population and preference archetype.

* Other common overall difference tests include:

a. Three Alternative Force Choice Test (3AFC)

b. Duo-Trio Test

####Magnitude Estimation
Flavor-attribute intensity testing is a category of tests where you select a specific set of the most important attributes in the product, and have your review team rate the intensity of each attribute on a numerical or physical scale of your choosing. Examples of a numerical scales includes integer (whole-number) or continuous (decimal numbers) values such as one through five (1 – 5) or one through ten (1-10). Examples of a physical scale include a line scale, where individuals mark intensity on a line:

{% picture post-images qc-email-course-images/emailcourse-linescale.png %}

You measure intensity as the distance from the beginning of the line to the marked point – we do not suggest this method for your quality control program because of the difficulty to implement and enter data.

While there are available systems of magnitude estimation, the best quality control programs choose the variables important to their product – both positive and negative. While there is no hard limit to the number of variables you select, managing more than 15 – 20 is difficult on a spreadsheet. At a minimum, you should record at least the 10 most important flavor-attributes in your product; less complete sensory profiles of your product lead to offloading – the increase in intensity scoring of related, but not exact, flavor attributes.

> If your test does not account for the important flavor-attributes in the product, your reviews will *offload* the missing flavors onto the categories you give them, which will misrepresent your product, and possibly assume that a bad batch is OK, or that a good batch has a certain flaw, taint, or contamination.

It is important that all of your reviewers are rating the intensity of the attribute and **not** how much the attribute is liked in any subjective sense.  This test can tell you exactly which attributes are deviant, and importantly, in which direction and by what magnitude the flavor attribute is varying.  This test requires more data than the Triangle Test: at least 30 reviews per batch for any statistical significance.  Problems may arise with this test when two (2) or more attributes are tightly correlated (causing statistical multiple-collinearity), when the selected flavor attributes are closely related, or when the reviewer has not been trained and calibrated on your selected flavor attributes.


<br>
####Descriptive Analysis

A descriptive analysis test is easy to run (after your panelists have been trained and calibrated), but requires huge amounts of data.  If your company has the ability to generate a minimum of 100 reviews per batch of product, you can simply ask people “what does this product taste like?” and statistically analyze their word choice.  This test works if you have the ability to link specific flavor terms back to specific chemical compounds such as potential flaws, taints, or contaminations – which is far out of scope for most companies. The Gastrograph system does it automatically by linking flavors and descriptive terms to our database of flavor compounds and bio-chemical pathways.

Whichever test you choose, you must record the results of every test.  Losing data, or selecting which tests to record biases your results and can cause you to miss batch variations or flaws in your product.  A basic written record and filing system will not work for statistically analyzing the results of descriptive analysis tests. Someone at your company must be responsible for looking over and calculating the results before every batch ships, and in nearly all circumstances a database such as a MySQL is required.

*If* you use this category of tests, which we do not suggest, you can either apply sentiment analysis to the corpus of words your reviewers use to describe your product, or use one of the many bag-of-words (word count) methods.  Both of these methods can be made more precise by asking reviewers to group words into pre-selected categories, and by including recursive n-gram analysis; for example, marking the negations such as the phrase ‘not sweet’ – this could be weighted similarly to a single marking of the term sweet, or a percentage of the positive mark.

###Our method:
The Gastrograph System runs tests from within each of the three categories using computerized statistical models and machine learning techniques – we run an average of three hundred plus variations of each test at the same time, 24 hours a day, 365 days a year.  Our tests allow you to see differences in your products’ flavor profile in real time, between batches, and through the descriptive terms that best describe the product.  For example:

For example:

* **Difference Testing:** we use a Bayesian time series analysis to monitor each batch of your product’s flavor profile and alert you with a phone call or email when a variation is detected. [You can read our white paper on this here.][bayesian-whitepaper]

* **Magnitude Estimation:** The Gastrograph itself is a Thurstonian Scaling model. Reviewers use the graph to record the intensity of each flavor attribute in the product. We then apply machine learning algorithms to classify each reviewer into a tasting population and preference archetype, removing large sources of variation and differences in perception.

    <ul><li><strong>Descriptive Analysis:</strong> Reviewers using the Gastrograph System can select or type specific <i>reference flavors</i> (such as grapefruit, oak, pine, or grassy) within each of our 24 <i>broad-spectrum flavor categories.</i>  Each of these notes is matched in our database with a set of underlying flavor signatures, which match specific chemical compounds that can be traced through the bio-chemical pathways of the production process.  Unstructured notes can be entered, and are used for sentiment analysis. In combination, these models help you describe your products to highlight the most positive attributes through our <i>cognitive marketing analysis.</i>  Better communication of your products’ flavor profile can prime consumers to focus on the most enjoyable attributes of your product.</li></ul>

Together, these tests and the thousands of environmental and reviewer variables we track can help you gain a reliable and consistent metric to measure and test your products’ flavor profile, consistency, and monitor for specific and potential flaws, taints, and contaminations in your product.

Finally, The Gastrograph System automates data collection through the review app for Android and iOS.  Your data is encrypted and triple replicated across two data-centers.  You never need to worry about backups, storage, or reliability of your data with our cloud based centralization and storage. With the Gastrograph  System, you don’t need to worry about data-loss, back-ups, or recording, analyzing, and reporting the results of your test.
