####Location, location, location...

...the mantra of the real estate agent. For beer brewers, location is only the first step. Once location is established, several other factors come into play that facilitate expansion - some quicker and some easier than others.

I've heard the story of brewpubs and microbreweries becoming giants in their local town and expanding regionally more times than I can count. It goes something along the lines of, "We started brewing only a handful of gallons a couple years ago and, as time went on, the community began to embrace us and growth became the rule, not the exception."

####Growth of Craft Breweries

{% picture post-images post-images/scaling-up-your-brewery-1.png "Source: https://www.brewersassociation.org/statistics/number-of-breweries/" %}

  * <em><strong>Microbrewery:</strong> A brewery that produces less than 15,000 barrels (17,600 hectoliters) of beer per year with 75 percent or more of its beer sold off-site</em>

  * <em><strong>Brewpub:</strong> A restaurant-brewery that sells 25 percent or more of its beer on site.</em>

  * <em><strong>Regional Brewery:</strong> A brewery with an annual beer production of between 15,000 and 6,000,000 barrels.</em>

  * <em><strong>Large Brewery:</strong> A brewery with an annual beer production over 6,000,000 barrels.</em>

The data from the Brewers Association shows us that building and sustaining a successful microbrewery is very achievable, averaging about 361 new microbreweries in the last 2 years with a remarkable growth rate of 27.8% last year. The number of regional breweries has gone up, on average, about 19 breweries a year and the growth rate was 13.4%. That's a little less than half the rate of microbrewery growth. In other words, for every new regional brewery there are about 19 new microbreweries opening.

The overall growth rate is at 19.4%, leading us to believe this trend will continue, but the real question is, "What is holding back some of the microbreweries from eclipsing 15,000 barrels a year?". These brewers must aspire to send out their creations as far and wide to as many people as possible, but that's only half the battle. The other half requires understanding the subtleties of distributing well beyond local lines.

First thing's first though, let's talk about achieving success at the local level. Face-to-face interactions shine at this level; building trust and connections with bars, bottle shops, and the local populace is what it takes to make it. Luckily, beer is a cultural staple and having a local craft brewery is fun, provides a community hangout spot, and is a business that people can be proud of. At this level of growth, the odds are definitely skewed in your favor and the 27.8% microbrewery growth rate only backs that up. Now more than ever, this is very achievable.

####User Experience as a Strategy for Sustainable Expansion

As craft beer continues to explode, will your brewery be coming along for the ride? What's going to set you apart is user experience. It's important to step back and ask yourself what key factors need to scale in becoming a regional and national craft beer brand.  User experience is composed of the following:

  * Labeling
  * Finding the right distributor
  * Cultural outreach
  * Consistency
  * High quality

####Labeling

Your brand says a lot about you, and for beer it's all about the packaging and labeling. Researching color perception, developing an aesthetic design, and making sure the label properly represents your brewery and your beer is essential to your first impression. We're all human, inevitably biased beings, and things like color and design definitely set a baseline expectation for your product. Experimentation across your various brews is a solid way to test what works and what doesn't, but honestly the most important thing is making sure the beer is what you like and want at the end of the day.

####Distributors

As of right now, it's impossible to know exactly where your beer is going, how it's being stored, and how quickly it's getting out to customers. Maybe that will change one day, but for now the best thing you can do is find a distributor you can depend on in the long run. There have been stories of beer that is stored at room temperature, little to no feedback on who's getting the beer and how fast they're getting it. Stone did something quite clever by releasing the Best By series and putting the best by date as the name of the beer. Any distributor holding onto it after that date is left holding something that nobody would end up wanting, but realistically speaking, not a lot of breweries have that kind of influence and can get away with that. For most breweries it's all about paying attention to things like a sudden high number of complaints of bad beer or customers saying that they can't find your beer anywhere. Getting that information is tough and the best advice may be to trust your intuition and look for the most reliable distributor in your area and make sure that you hold them accountable and build a lasting relationship.

####Cultural Outreach

The further you distribute, the tougher it is to maintain a personable connection with your customers. At the local level, your target customers are all within driving range and you appear easily accessible to them. Breweries host live music events, beer tapping, and 'Firkin Fridays' to establish and maintain a culture that they believe in for the town that they live in. These events give your brewery a chance to actually speak to the people that support your brewery and communicate what your team stands for. Of course this gets tougher as distance becomes a factor.

At the regional level, you're going to need to handle outreach with a more strategic approach. Your team probably already has a long list of responsibilities that are essential to the brewery's success. A few breweries work around this by sending a sales representative to host a Meet the Brewer tasting event sometime during their trip. Sponsoring events that restaurants and bars are already planning on having is a great way to spread your brand. You could also try sending special seasonal kegs that will be much appreciated by both the bar and your loyal customers.

####Quality & Consistency

At the end of the day, the user experience is what the customer thinks of your beer. What kind of impression did you leave when they first tried it? When they tried it again, did it taste as they remembered? Customer loyalty is a simple recipe: quality and consistency.

Being objective about your beer is extremely difficult, but necessary for success. Do you only drink the beer that you brew? What are your favorite beers made by other breweries? How much beer variety do you typically experience every month? Having a firm grasp on the market trends partially involves being in-tune with the times and being able to have things to compare and contrast with your own product.

Sensory panels can help a lot with this and allow you to organize your thoughts and personal perceptions in a structured way to get an idea of customer experience. Empathy goes a long way; you'll have to remember that they do not work at your brewery and can not possibly see the hard work and effort that you put towards your creation. They also have a preconceived idea that the beer they are getting should always taste the same, every single time. The Gastrograph System allows people to review and input their individual subjective flavor experiences. This data is filtered through subjectivity-stripping data science models and scanned for flaws through analytical chemistry models. This gives brewers actionable data that they can use to protect their brand and prevent the shipping of bad batches and serves as a final checkpoint that will grant you peace of mind and assurance when you send your beer out into the world.
