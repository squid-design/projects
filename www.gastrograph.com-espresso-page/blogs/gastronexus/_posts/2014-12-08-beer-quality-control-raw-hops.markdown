Hops are one of the most important ingredients of beer. It contributes bitterness, complexity, flavor, and aroma. Hops not only play an important role in taste, but they also contribute to the color and clarity of the beer. Hops were originally used to aid in beer preservation.

One of hops’ defining roles in beer production is bitterness. Hops balance and help counteract the natural sweetness of beer. Alpha acids are the primary bitter compound that hops contribute to beer. Alpha acids undergo isomerization reactions to form iso-alpha acids. The IBU (International Bitterness Units) is a relative scale that spectrophotometrically determines iso-alpha acids in beer. IBUs can be utilized to not only compare the bitterness between two different beers, but can also be used as a quality control measure to ensure a consistent level of bitterness.

Hops not only add a pleasant bitterness to a beer’s flavor profile, but contribute many other flavors and aromas. Hops come in many different cultivars, each with their own unique flavors and aromas.

Hops contain high amounts of hydrocarbons that add pleasant aromas and complexity to beer. These different hydrocarbons, commonly referred to as “hop oil,” are mainly terpenes and susquiterpenes. Due to the fact that these hydrocarbons are highly volatile and easily evaporate, most of them are lost during wort boiling. However, trace amounts of them remain, and provide many of the beer’s positive flavor and aroma attributes. Hops can also be added to the wort late in the boiling process to increase the amount of flavor and aromatic compounds in the beer. Hop oil vaporization is a very time and temperature dependent process; the longer the hops are in the boiling wort, the more hop oil will evaporate. This is often done for specific types of beer in order to achieve a specific flavor profile.

The color of beer is an important aspect of a beer’s perceived quality. Hops affect this key visual indicator of quality. Hops contain polyphenols, which will be released into the beer and affect the color and clarity of the beer. The age of the hops also plays a significant role in the color they impart in beer. The older the hops, the more color will be imparted to the beer. Therefore it is important to consider that when hops are purchased in bulk, they will change over time and impact the beer.

Blending hop cultivars is a common technique in the craft brewing industry. Blending hops will create a more complex beer and can even out any off-flavors that are coming from any one particular hop. This is the same logic that is applied to blending wine or coffee to create a more dynamic, even, and consistent cup or glass. Blending also helps reduce how dependent a brewer is on a particular hop cultivar or specific type of hop.

Single hop beers are fairly common in the craft beer industry as well as single hop-single malt beers known as SMaSH beer (single malt and single hop).  These can have unique and appealing flavor profiles, but there are several disadvantages to making single hop beers. In terms of flavor, many single hop beers can be quite simplistic, not offering the dynamic flavor complexity that blends do. Whenever utilizing a less common hop cultivar for producing a single hop beer there is inherent risk of that hop being unavailable.

#### Recommendations
- Avoid using hops of significantly different ages from brew to brew of the same beer to ensure consistency

- Ensure that your hops have consistent alpha and beta acid content and consider adjusting dosage if they vary from batch to batch

- When making a single hop beers be sure that your hop supplier is reliable and can consistently deliver the same hops over the course of a production run for a particular beer
