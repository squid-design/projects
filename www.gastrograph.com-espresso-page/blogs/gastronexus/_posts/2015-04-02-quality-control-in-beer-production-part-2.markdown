####Introduction
The importance of pH in brewing is often underestimated.  The pH during brewing is important because, like temperature, pH dictates many processes during brewing.  The pH affects how different substances are extracted from ingredients, the behavior and solubility of proteins, and the activity of enzymes.  In some situations controlling the pH may not be necessary, but by monitoring pH one can tell the progress and condition of the brew.

Many processes in brewing are highly dependent on the pH of the environment.  The pH of a solution is a measure of how acidic it is.  The “p” is a mathematical operator that means “–log ()” of something, and the “H” stands for the concentration of hydrogen ions in solution.  The more hydrogen ions are in a solution the more acidic it is and the lower the pH will be.  The pH can be used to tell if something is acidic, basic, or neutral.  A pH below 7 means a substance is acidic and a pH above 7 means a substance is basic.  Something is considered to be neutral if the pH is approximately 7.  The simplest definition of an acid is something that gives up a hydrogen ion (H+) in solution, and a base, would then accept a hydrogen ion.  Some acids will completely dissociate when dissolved in water these are called strong acids.  An example would be hydrochloric acid (HCl).  When HCl is dissolved in water it dissociates into H+ and chloride ions (Cl-).  If an acid such as lactic acid (shown below) does not completely dissociate when dissolved it is called a weak acid.  This means that the dissociation is a reversible process.

This incomplete dissociation allows for a phenomenon known as buffering.  Buffering of a solution happens when an acid and its conjugate base, or negative ion, are both dissolved in the same solution.  Buffers make it more difficult to change the pH of a solution.  This is why alkalinity is often used in the place of pH.  Many compounds in brewing are weak acids and this gives beer a buffering capacity.  Thankfully, beer is buffered to a pH near the ideal pH ranges for different brewing processes.

There are a few different ways to measure pH.  The first is titration this is where a solution of known acid or base concentration, the titrant, is added slowly to a sample of unknown concentration, or analyte, until and endpoint is reached.  The endpoint is usually a color change brought about by an added indicator dye.  There are also more immediate methods to measure pH such as pH paper and pH probes.  pH paper is a paper saturated with a number of different pH indicator dyes of different colors that react in different pH ranges.  When a sample is introduced to the paper the dyes react and the resultant color can be used to determine the pH of the sample.  The pH probe uses electrochemistry to measure the reaction potential of ions in solution.  As two substances come in contact with each other a potential is created due to the difference in electron mobilities of the two substances.  This measurable voltage can be used to determine the concentration of ions in solution and therefore can be used to find pH.  Often pH probes are used as an additional tool in titration.  For most brewers, pH paper or a pH probe are the quickest easiest way to determine pH.  It is important to remember that for consistency pH measurements should always be taken at the same points during the beer making process.  It should be noted that the pH of a process may change significantly in the course of just a few minutes.

####Mashing
The pH during mash making is important because it controls the extraction of proteins and sugars from the malt as well enzymatic activity.   During mashing enzymes such as α-amylase, β-amylase, and β-Glucanase break large carbohydrate molecules down into fermentable sugars.  These enzymes are most efficient in certain pH ranges.  If the pH of the mash is too far outside these ranges then there will not be enough sugar present for fermentation to take place.  The table below shows the preferred pH ranges of each enzyme.  Amaylases and glucanases break starches down into simple sugars.  Proteases are enzymes that break down proteins. This is bad for foam stability and flavors in the beer.  The pH range of highest activity for proteases should be avoided to ensure a higher quality product.  The optimum pH range for most mashes is between pH 5.2 and pH 5.8.

The type of malt used will influence the pH of the mash.  Darker malts will cause the mash to be more acidic because of acids that formed from sugars in the grain during kilning.  Paler malts will usually result in a higher pH.

If mash pH is too high this can be rectified by the addition of gypsum, inorganic acid (i.e. HCl, H2SO4, or H3PO4) or organic acid, such as lactic acid, until the pH is in the desired range.  Malt containing lactic acid, known as acid malt can also be used to lower pH.  If mash pH is too low the addition of CaCO3 can raise it to the desired range.  When adjusting pH it is important not to overshoot the target pH.  This can be ensured by adding a small amount of the adjusting substance stirring thoroughly and waiting a few minutes before measuring again.  The amount of substance added should be roughly proportional to the change in pH.  This means that if the addition of x grams of CaCO3 changes the pH by y, then the addition of x more grams of CaCO3 will change the pH by about y again. An alternate method is to make a small test batch or extract a small amount and see how much acid or base is required to change the pH to the desired value then scale up for the rest of the beer.  It is also possible to calculate the amount of acid or base need to change the pH.  This however might be difficult because of the complex mixture of substances in the mash.

####Boiling
The pH during wort boiling is important because it controls protein coagulation and α-acid isomerization.  Protein coagulation is when haze-causing proteins stop being soluble and precipitate out of the wort, coagulating into masses known as trub.  This precipitation of protein not only deters haze in the beer it also promotes foam stability.  A pH of less than 5.6 is desired for optimum protein coagulation.  If the pH is lower than 5.0 though protein coagulation is reduced.

Boiling also marks the introduction of hops for most beers.  Hops contain humulones or α-acids.  These α-acids are virtually tasteless, but the heat from boiling converts humulones, or α-acids to isohumulones or iso-α-acids.  Iso-α-acids are the compounds that cause the bitter flavor in beer associated with hops.  After this isomerization the isohumulones would also precipitate from solution if the pH is too high.

The pH at the beginning of the boil should be somewhere between 5.2 and 5.6.  As the wort boils, the pH will drop by about 0.25.  This means that if a wort starts the boil between 5.2 and 5.6 it should end the boil between. 5.0 and 5.4.  Controlling the pH of the wort is done much the same was as controlling mash pH.  If it’s too high an acid is added to lower it and if it is too low CaCO3 is added to raise it.

####Fermentation
Yeast thrive at slightly lower pH.  They will also change the pH of the environment themselves.  Yeast will naturally lower the pH of a wort during fermentation via CO2 and succinic acid production.  When the yeast is added there will be a sharp drop in pH from near 5.2, where the boil was finished, to near 4.2.  The value after the drop is dependent on the type of yeast used and therefore the type of beer being made.  For most lagers the pH will drop to between 4.2 and 4.4, and as low as 3.8 for some ales.

The pH control process by the yeast makes controlling the pH during fermentation fairly unimportant.  This does not mean though that it is an unimportant measurement.  Monitoring pH during fermentation can identify a problem in the beer.  If the pH of the beer changes much pass the initial drop then the beer is most likely infect by some undesired bacteria most commonly Lactobacillus or Pedicoccus.  In some beers though, a sour flavor is desired and bacteria such as Lactobacillus, Pedicoccus, and/or Bettanomyces is added to give this trait to the beer.  The pH is then monitored and when the desired level is reached fermentation is stopped

####Finished Beer
The pH of the finished product should be measured to ensure quality.  Beers that undergo the same conditions during brewing should have the same or at least similar pH values.  If they do not then something went wrong.  Shown below are typical pH ranges for a few common beer styles.  Also lower pH inhibits the growth of microorganisms so a beer with a low pH will stay fresh for longer than one with a higher pH.

Some brewers may want to make a sour beer, but don’t want to add a live culture to the fermenter and consequently pasteurize to eliminate the bacteria.  The finished beer can then be acidified by adding lactic or tartaric acid.  This will adjust to the final pH and give the sour flavor notes desired in the beer.  This should be done to taste and the amount of acid added along with the pH of the finished beer should be noted to ensure product consistency.

####Yeast Washing
Many brewers reuse the yeast that was used in the previous fermentation to help ensure product consistency.  In order to keep the yeast alive and get rid of any other unwanted microorganisms the yeast must be washed.  To do this the yeast is added to a solution of H2SO4, H3PO4, citric acid, or tartaric acid.  More acid is then added to the mixture until the pH is lowered to 2.  At pH 2 the yeast is able to survive but the bacteria in question cannot.

####Conclusion
Control of pH is important in achieving a quality product.  Especially during mashing, and boiling.  It can be measured quickly using pH paper or a pH probe, the second of which allows for much greater accuracy.  Control of pH is as simple as adding acids to lower the pH and CaCO3 to raise it.  Luckily the process of fermentation the pH is controlled by the yeast but should still be monitored closely.  The monitoring of pH can help to ensure that nothing has gone wrong during the brewing process and unexpected changes are often the result of bacterial infection.
