####Yeast Health

Where does flavor come from when brewing beer? You can achieve rich body through quality malts and introduce citrus and floral characteristics through fresh hops. Yeast also plays a major role in contributing to beer flavor. It is not only a natural way of producing alcohol and carbonation in our favorite beverage but also can introduce a wide variety of flavors that allow saisons to taste of spices or give lambics such a “wild” deliciousness. Fermentation is where the magic happens, and it is also the step in beer production where most flaws can arise. Every brewer understands the absolute importance of maintaining a sterile work environment, keen observation, and an attentive palate. It is equally as important to understand what goes on in the fermentation tank to combat possible flaws and keep your yeast friends happy.

####“Aerobic” Fermentation

Like humans, yeast are eukaryotic critters, and they have the same basic needs as us: glucose, oxygen, and TLC. However, as we know very well yeast have another metabolic pathway that produces some of life’s greatest food stuffs: bread, beer, and wine. Fermentation is a way of breaking down glucose to generate ATP (an energy storage molecule) in a way that does not require the presence of oxygen with a much lower turnover rate. Instead of a net gain of 28 ATP molecules through aerobic respiration, fermentation only yields two ATP molecules. Therefore, respiration is the preferred metabolic pathway so yeast cells will respire when oxygen is present. Respiration is especially bad when it comes to beer brewing, because yeast respires glucose as well as ethanol. This means that ethanol can be converted into the precursor molecule for aerobic respiration – pyruvate. In this instance, respiration of ethanol will produce acetic acid, an unwanted vinegar-like byproduct.

Thankfully, brewer’s yeast will undergo fermentation even in the presence of oxygen through a phenomenon we call the Crabtree effect. This effect is a metabolic regulatory mechanism that represses the respiration pathway if fermentable sugars are available for fermentation. Knowing this, we can say for sure that acetic acid flaws in beer are not due to yeast respiration but instead to the metabolic products of Acetobacteria, which are using oxygen to respire – this is a whole different problem (these microbes oxidize ethanol to acetic acid to generate energy). Therefore, not only can oxygen be present, it should be present to ensure that happy, healthy yeast are pitched and sustained in batch fermentation.

Yeast will not die in the absence of oxygen, but in the long run yeast will significantly benefit from the presence of oxygen. Oxygen allows yeast to undergo biosynthesis of unsaturated fatty acids and sterols. These two macromolecules are major components of yeast cell membranes, and their synthesis promotes budding and general well-being of strong, efficient cells. Once cells are depleted of sterols yeast growth will halt. Furthermore, weak cells are prone to get stuck in fermentation, which can lead to more problems that impart a variety of off-flavors in your beer. Viability and vitality of cells are crucial in flawless fermentation.

Brewers need to take diligent caution during aeration because aerating too early or too late can significantly affect flavor for different reasons. To prevent the possibility of oxidizing the wort, avoid aerating at high temperatures because bound oxygen molecules can react with various compounds within the wort like sugars and proteins. Even turbulence in the wort (i.e. splashing) can promote oxidation of the wort. By the time primary fermentation has begun, it’s already too late to aerate the wort because of the increased likelihood of yeast cells to produce off-flavor byproducts such as diacetyl (rancid butter taste) and trans-2-nonenal (causes staling).

Take care of your cells and you will not have the need to re-pitch. Also, keep in mind that health requirements for each yeast strain varies. Certain strains may be more delicate than others. Though it is impossible to have a universal set of rules for aeration because of the variables of beer style and yeast strain, here are some general tips for keeping yeast healthy in terms of oxygen presence.

  * Aerate before fermentation and never after
  * Cool the wort to fermentation temperature before introducing oxygen
  * After fermentation is complete, limit oxygen presence or your beer will oxidize and become stale
  * Keep in mind oxygen does not dissolve in high gravity worts and therefore requires longer aeration  times
  * Know your yeast strain - though yeast do not need oxygen, get to know the strain you are using to achieve optimal aeration
