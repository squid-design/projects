description: Interview with Gastrograph's Chemical Engineer Zachary Bushman.

**What type of work do you do for Gastrograph?**

I am a chemist by training and am currently in charge of developing instrumentation for measuring conditions during fermentation.  This instrumentation will help to provide real-time monitoring and analysis of the fermentation process.  It should allow for better quality control in the brewing processes.

**What sparked your interest in working in that field?**

I started undergrad as an engineer and while I was in a required chemistry class I came to the realization that I like chemistry more.  At this point I’m not sure if I actually liked chemistry more than engineering or I liked my chemistry professor more than my engineering professors.  I was very involved in my chemistry class that first semester and changed my major a few weeks after starting school.

**Why did you choose AFS?**

I have always loved quantifying the amount of a substance in a sample.  I have also always loved beer and coffee.  The choice was simple.  AFS took two things I like, combined them, and made a job out of it.

**Gastrograph has a pretty unique environment. What would you say your favorite part is?**

I would have to say my favorite part is the energy at Hacker House.  When everyone is sitting doing their work and exchanging their ideas. There’s nothing quite like it.  The atmosphere is serious and productive but friendly and relaxed at the same time.

**You get to evaluate many different drinks. What product is your favorite to taste test?**

Who doesn’t like beer?

**Why is that?**

I grew up in Wisconsin where beer is a way of life.  My dad taught me what good beer is and how to appreciate one that you may not necessarily like.  I also associate beer with camaraderie, friendship, and trust.  To quote Nick Offerman, “It’s better to have 8 guys with one beer each, than to have 8 beers to yourself.”

**Working at a startup can be time consuming. What activities do you do in your free time to alleviate the stress?**

I play rugby.  What better way to relieve stress than to tackle complete strangers and do battle for 80 minutes?  Then at the end of the match it’s off to the social where you share good food and drink with your opponents.

**If you were a character from Star Wars, which one would you be?**

I would be Obi-Wan Kenobi.  He keeps his cool and isn’t easily angered, but he is still someone you shouldn’t mess with.  His wisdom helps him to do things the right way instead of the easy way.  He is cautious and focused, and he is a Jedi… pretty sweet if you ask me.

**What would you choose as your last meal?**

My last meal would start with a chicken Caesar salad and a cup of French onion soup.  Then I would have Venison tenderloin with mushrooms, tomatoes, and a creamy horseradish sauce.  To drink I would have New Glarus’ Spotted Cow.  For dessert, cheesecake with fresh blueberries and raspberries alongside a glass of Laphroaig 18.

**If you were given a free full-page ad in the newspaper and had to sell yourself in six words or less, how would the ad read?**

“Ambitious, quick learner, willing to assist,” and I’m left wondering why I can only put six words on a whole page.

**Who would win a battle between a ninja and a pirate?**

That depends on the conditions of the fight.  If it is a face to face fight I would give the edge to the pirate, as he probably has more swordplay experience and is better at one on one combat.  The ninja, on the other hand, is stealthy and an effective assassin.  He could easily take the pirate out before they stepped into the ring.
