**What type of work do you do for Gastrograph?**

I am in charge of finding new clientele and working towards securing long-term clients that want easy to use and effective quality control.

**What sparked your interest in working in that field?**

My dislike of what a standard salesman is. I don't want to push people into doing anything, I want them to pull themselves to me.

**Why did you choose AFS?**

AFS has an excellent core group of hard workers and generally fun people. The environment is friendly and I have more freedom here that allows me to push myself and grow.

**Gastrograph has a pretty unique environment. What would you say your favorite part is?**

That I will get fired if I don't drink beer.

**You get to evaluate many different drinks. What product is your favorite to taste test?**

I like beer the most, I've always had a preference for that in terms of alcohol and craft brewing continues to expand its artistry and create more and more new combinations and flavors.

**Working at a startup can be time consuming. What activities do you do in your free time to alleviate the stress?**

I stay active physically and always try to advance my style. Music, fashion, any type of art you know. To be honest though, most of the stress at work is good.

**If you were given a free full-page ad in the newspaper and had to sell yourself in six words or less, how would the ad read?**

Moderation in everything including moderation.
