Working with a flavor analysis company has taught me more than just tasting. I’ve found that all of our senses are all connected, and each effect how we perceive and respond to flavor. Mind, body, and, well, taste buds. I was trained as a professional tea taster by The Tea Institute at Penn State. When I first began thinking about flavor, it was difficult for me to decide what references I was making and conclusions I was drawing. Taste is a connection between the mind and sense of taste that isn’t exercised nearly enough - it takes practice to understand.

When I started working for Analytical Flavor Systems, I began to explore other products like beer and coffee. Working here has helped me realize how much I like beer! Tea, coffee, and beer have very different nuances and underlying characteristics to be explored. It’s important to go into each tasting with an open mind - it leaves you more capable to learn new things about a product, as well as your own preferences.

I find that the more I taste and explore, the more subtitles and nuance I am able to find in new products, and the more successful and accomplished I feel about the overall review. When you begin a Gastrograph review, you choose a product class, such as beer, and fill in more information about it in the meta data section. The more experience you have with a class, naturally the more references you can draw. I like to think of this as gaining expertise in a profession or craft - the more experience , the more weight your opinion has. I'm not a data scientist, but those guys tell me I have one of the highest [experience weights.][whitepapers]

When I grade something in fruitiness or bitterness on a scale of 1 to 5 (5 being extremely fruity), I do so in reference to that particular style of beer. Let’s run through an example; if I was tasting an imperial IPA, I might mark a 3 or 4 on floral, suggesting that this beer is higher on the spectrum of other imperial IPA’s I’ve tasted before; **not** all beers in general. The same goes for the Perceived Quality. I don't think about how **"good"** this product is or how much I like it - that's inconsistent and varies way too much on my day. Rather, I think in terms of quality. A Perceived Quality score of 7 would be the highest level of quality a product can get in it's class. In my eyes, this should not be how much I liked the product, because that would be a bit absolutist to assume everything I like is true and valid to everyone's opinion. It's best in my eyes to stay objective.

You may think this would create confusion when everyone thinks differently, but luckily our system can account for user experience not only in the history of beers I’ve tried, but also the amount of reviews I’ve done.

What’s important is to be honest with your review and not fill it out hedonically. If you just put what you feel is present in the flavors, you can do no wrong.

Everyone tastes differently - that's a beauty of the data we analyze, and people approach a review differently. In the future, I look forward to what this method of tasting may reveal in the human population. I know that personally, I’ve already found attributes about myself that I didn’t know simply though thinking more about what’s going on with my taste buds. I don't like beers that are overly hoppy, but have a high sensitivity to mineral contents due to tea tastings. I love Flemish sours, but heavy woody notes often over-power the subtleties I enjoy and look for.

Think, engage, and taste more artisan products- it’ll do yourself more good than you know.
