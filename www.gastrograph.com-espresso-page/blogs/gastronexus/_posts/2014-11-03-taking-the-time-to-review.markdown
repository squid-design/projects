The number one reason we hear from beer brewers, coffee roasters, artisan disillers, and other craft beverage producers about not implementing a quality control program is the time commitment. Starting a quality control program is hard to fit into an already packed schedule, which includes production, packaging, selling, and more. As an artisan producer, you are often short staffed and have to produce more products at higher quality as the demand for  a product increases.

Before you sign any distribution agreements or sell your product offsite, having a quick *sniff or taste* test can be enough of a quality control program.  In these cases, your product won't be going through many temperature fluctuations and usually will only last a few weeks before it is sold.  The rewards of a rigorous program might not outweigh the cost of time.  But, when you start to distribute, it will be well worth the time.

Even craft products can take a lesson from large manufacturers of every type of product. One lesson is Six Sigma. At the core of Six Sigma is keeping the occurrence of defects down to 3.4 parts per million.  In the craft industry, that might not be the exact goal you are shooting for, but Six Sigma also provides great lessons from the process to achieve that consistency.

When manufacturers first started to implement the Six Sigma methodology it began with stopping the entire manufacturing line each time a defect was found.  At first, the executives of these factories were skeptical, as shutting down the line meant losing money, productivity and more; but, each time the line was inspected and the defect was analyzed until a root cause was found. When a solution to remove the cause was found, the line started up again.  Slowly the frequency of the line being stopped began to drop. Overall, revenue went up as fewer defects were found.

The Six Sigma methodology won't directly work for a sensory-based quality control program because of the underlying probability distribution distribution of human response to flavor. Instead, the Gastrograph System includes new machine learning and data science techniques that build off the original Westinghouse and Six Sigma technology&mdash;helping you create a measurable and actionabl quality control program that can catch flaws, taints, contaminations, and batch devaitions.

In the end, taking the time to remove the defect saved valuable amounts of time. How does this relate to quality control?  Establishing quality control practices now will save time and money in the future.  Now is the time to do it.  By finding problems in your products, no matter how small, you will be able to improve efficiency, profit, and customer satisfaction.  Your goal might always be to stay small and serve local customers, but everyone wants to make the best product they possibly can. The craft market is growing faster than ever before and new producers are making more products in more styles, giving customers the most amount of choice yet. In the long run, it will be the producers that invest in making a consistently high-quality product through quality control that grow their brand and succeed in the market.

One situation of getting the most value out of quality control is barrel aging.  Whether you are taking a white spirit and aging it in an oak barrel, taking your latest pumpkin beer and aging it in a rum barrel, or even taking coffee and aging it in a barrel as some are doing; making sure your product is perfect before putting it in the barrel is important.  There are many costs associated with aging a product, but it is always worth it when you see your customer try that first sip and smile in satisfaction.

Taking the time to set up a quality control program now will ensure that product tastes just as good as you imagined when you remove it from the barrel.
So, take the time&mdash;establishing the quality control program now will be well worth its weight in gold.  It can be as simple as spending 5 minutes reviewing a product using the Gastrograph System.
