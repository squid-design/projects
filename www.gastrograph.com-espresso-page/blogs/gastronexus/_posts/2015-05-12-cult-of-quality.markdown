description: Jason Cohen's Cult of Quality

On weekends, I've been working on determining the age of rare and old teas by using machine learning and artificial intelligence. Read an excerpt <a href="/blogs/gastronexus/cult-of-quality.html">below</a> from my personal blog <a href="http://www.cultofquality.com/index.php/2015/05/projects-in-machine-learning-and-artificial-intelligence-on-tea/">Cult of Quality</a>.

<blockquote style="margin: 25px 0;">
  <p>"Verifying the age of pu’er [tea] is a difficult undertaking. Cakes can be faked, wrappers can be forged, even the manufacturing house has an incentive to make the tea taste “older” than it is (hence all of the sheng cakes with “just a little bit” of shou in them from the 90’s).</p>

  <p>Last time I went to China to purchase some pu’er, I found lugging my radio carbon lab a bit inconvenient, and, being an inventive chap, I realized (with some re-inspiration from this last event) that I could model the flavor signatures from known old samples of pu’er tea, and get a fairly accurate age range from sensory data alone!</p>

  <p>I’ve been experimenting with multivariate adaptive regression splines on data preprocessed with a unsupervised metric learning implementation of local fisher discriminant analysis. There are a few other data tuning tricks I will need to use, but for now this is yielding viable results."</p>
