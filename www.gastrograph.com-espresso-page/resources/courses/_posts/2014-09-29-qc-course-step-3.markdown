The best quality control programs include a diverse set of trained panelists. Panelists are the individuals from your company you select for reviewing responsibility. This is an important responsibility because missing data or inconsistent reviews will bias your results and cause you to misidentify good and bad batches of your product. The employees on your panel need to be held accountable to the products and schedule you set, and this must be given the same level of importance as their other full-time responsibilities (the Gastrograph Employee Management Panel shows you who’s reviewing what products, how often, and if their reviews are of high quality).

> Effective quality control programs don't use more product than necessary - your sensory team should be as large as manageable, and no larger.

Your panelists should be selected from across your company, so that there are individuals from your production team (brewers, distillers, or roasters), your front of house staff (baristas or bartenders), and your sales and marketing departments. This will help your entire team gain knowledge and experience with a range of flavor profiles, and help them learn to communicate the unique attributes of your products. Reviewing your coffee, beer, or spirits consistently will make each of the individuals on your panel more sensitive to the qualities of your products, and will help them produce, describe, recommend, and sell more of your brand.

When selecting your panel, follow these guidelines:

1. Select a minimum of (4) four people for your panel. At least one of these individuals should be directly responsible for the product (such as the brewmaster, green-coffee buyer, or head distiller). More panelists will yield more data and more accurate results.

2. Select an even number of men and women. There should never be more than 20% more of a single gender on your tasting team unless you market and sell your product primarily to that gender.

3. Create a clear set of expectations for the panelists. Each panelist should know the number of reviews that they are expected to complete every week, and the times those reviews are scheduled. The Gastrograph System makes this easy, as each panelist can use the Gastrograph mobile app to review on their own schedule.

4. Have a ‘clean palate’ rule. Create a list of blacklist foods that cannot be consumed within 3 hours of a panel.  Common blacklist foods include: spicy peppers, raw onions and garlic, or tropical fruit such as bananas, papayas, coconut, and avocado. Each of these foods numb or coat the palate and make it harder or impossible for your panelists to determine changes in the flavor-profile of your product, reducing their ability to flag and identify a batch variation, flaw, taint, or contamination.

5. Select back-up panelists for the times when employees get sick, go on vacation, or forget to show up for a review. It happens!

6. Never include more than (3) three products in a one-hour tasting period. Palate contamination will skew your results and cause bias in the data you collect.

7. Always order product tastings from least intense to most intense – otherwise the product you taste first will cover up important subtleties and nuances of the products that follow.

20% of your company is a good baseline for the number of panelists in your quality control program; the more panelists you include the easier it will be to create statistically significant results capable of detecting flaws, taints, and variations in your products - but each panelist will require more time, product, and analysis to review and train. The panel should be as large as possible, but no larger. The average panel size ranges from 4 individuals in the smallest companies, to over 100 in the largest artisan producers.

If your brand or some of your products target a select demographic, it may be important to have a separate panel which matches the demographics of your consumers for each product or group.  For example, if one of your products sells primarily to cost-sensitive college students, it may be best to have the members of your team closest to that demographic on the panel. Alternatively, if one of your products is significantly more expensive and appeals to individuals who are enthusiasts, your employee base may match the demographic perfectly.

It is a common mistake to include only the most experienced members of your team on your panel; while more experienced reviewers can often taste more subtleties and are more sensitive to the potential flaws in your product, they are, on average, further from the experience of your average customer and bias your results towards the highest end of the experience spectrum. Not including less experienced employees on your panel also limits their ability to learn and grow their tasting experience inside your company. For these reasons we suggest including a range of experience levels in your panel, and weighting the results. For example, our models count each experienced review as a weighted multiple of an inexperienced review ranging from one (equal to a baseline inexperienced review) to three (the theoretical "most experienced reviewer" across the entire product class).

Once you have selected your panelists, you will need to invest time and products with which to train them. Training is explained in part 5 of this course.

###Our method:
The Gastrograph System uses three statistical models to create knowledge gain and insight into the flavor profiles and consistency of your product:

1. The Reviewer Model
2. The Environmental Model
3. The Product Model

We apply the reviewer model when interpreting panelists' physiological responses to flavor. The Gastrograph System is able to control for changes in panelists, their demographics, and how well their reviews of your product reflect the perception of your consumers. Each member of your panel has their own account on the [Gastrograph Review Mobile App][how-to-review] which tracks their review history, learns their sensitivity to specific flavor attributes, and uses displayed phenotypic classification to categorize them into a tasting population and preference archetype. This controls for sources of variation and bias in your quality control program, and gives you a more accurate view of the flavor profile and variations in your product.

Because of the Gastrograph System's ability to control for reviewer and environmental variations through these models, it is easier (and suggested) for you to include a wider range of reviewers in your panel. Gastrograph Review for iOS and [Android][android] includes life-cycle and adaptive panel training, which uses each reviewer's past review history and learned sensitivities to create individualized training which help them learn to perceive subtleties and correct attribution errors.
