#### Malting
Malting is the first fundamental step in beer production. The malting process prepares the raw grain for the rest of the brewing process. Malting “unlocks” the fermentable compounds and can impart additional flavor to the grain during kilning.

Malt modification is the most critical step in bringing out the bulk of the fermentable material. Modification is the process where the barley is partially germinated. This helps break the kernel out of dormancy as it starts to break down its energy-rich endospore comprised of starch. During this process, the plant produces many catabolic enzymes to convert the energy rich starch into sugars such as maltose.

Malt modification is an art in its own right. The malt has to be modified just enough so that it produces enzymes that can catabolize starch, but doesn’t use all of the starch; otherwise there will be no material for the yeast to ferment. There are several things that go wrong during malt modification; most of them deal with over or under modifying the malt – kilning a sprouted plant will create unpalatable malt.

One problem that can result from poor malt modification is inadequate foam stability and head retention in the finished beer. Protein Z is a protein that is primarily found in barley and significantly contributes to foam head retention. Premature malt can result in a deficit of necessary amounts of protein Z to achieve stable foam. If head retention and foam stability are problematic in a particular beer, it may be the result of malt that has not been properly modified.

Kilning is the last step in the malting process. It is the step in which most of the water is removed from the barley and where the critical browning reactions and other chemical processes occur. Kilning’s greatest effect is on the color and flavor of the beer. Maillard browning reactions take place during this step to convert reducing sugars and amino groups into pigment and flavor compounds. Barley can undergo various degrees of kilning to create a wide variety of malt to impart different flavors and color into the beer. Kilning helps remove negative “green notes” (herbaciousness and woodiness) caused by aldehydes from the germinated barley.

It also releases a variety of other fermentable material such as free amino nitrogen for the yeast to metabolize. It is important to also consider that the more a barley is kilned, the more enzymes are denatured. This will reduce the diastatic power of the mash. Therefore it is important to consider how much each type of barley will contribute to the overall diastatic power of the mash. Calculating the diastatic power, in degrees Lintner resulting from the malt selection, is advisable to ensure adequate amounts of fermentable material is produced. This can be calculated from the diastatic power listed on the packaging of most malted grain.

#### Selecting the Malt Bill
The malt bill is the heart of any beer, responsible for determining most of the flavor profile. Malt is most commonly produced from barley, wheat, and rye. It is the primary source of fermentable material and it imparts many of the flavor compounds found in beer.

When determining the constituents of the malt bill, the first and foremost consideration should be flavor. At the very least, the malt bill should taste good. A simple, yet effective test when blending a malt bill is to taste it. It is advisable to taste the malt for every batch to ensure consistency throughout a production run of a particular beer. The malts selected for the malt bill have a profound impact on the beer’s flavor profile.

Barley based malt comes in a full spectrum of colors and flavors depending on the processing method during malting.  There is amber malt, aromatic malt, chocolate malt, and black malt just to name a few. Different malts have different extraction potentials. This is an important consideration when designing a malt bill.

Non-barley malt bill constituents, such as oats, rice, and corn, contribute flavor and aroma and are  a common addition to beer. However, depending on the type of specialty malt utilized, it can result in various other problems by the introduction of other compounds. For example, oats contain a lot of oil and other lipids, which can greatly impact foam stability in beer. When adding these malts, it is advisable to consider the possible adverse affects it could have on the beer.

Gravity is a general term that essentially refers to the density of a liquid as it compares to water.  Achieving target gravity based on extraction-potential calculations is a critical point in beer consistency from brew to brew. Not hitting a desired original gravity could result in adverse flavor problems, alcohol content, and fermentation in general. Total gravity should be one of the foremost considerations when taking quality control measures in the malt bill.

The malt bill is the principle contributor to beer color. Malted barley, and other grains that have undergone the heat treatment during kilning, supply the beer with melanoidins and other pigment molecules that arise during Maillard browning, oxidation, and caramelization reactions. Polyphenols are also another major source of colored molecules in beer. The husks of the grain used are the primary source of polyphenols among the raw ingredients that make up beer. Therefore increased breaking and grinding of the malt will result in higher concentrations of polyphenols extracted from the malt.

To ensure consistent levels of polyphenols and, likewise, color, it is advisable to have a consistent level of grind for the malt. **The degree of coarseness in the grind of the malt can be used to tune the color of the beer, as well as the extraction potential of the mash.** Another key point to take into consideration in malt selection is its nitrogen content. Maillard browning reactions are dependent on adequate nitrogen levels. Any change in the degree of nitrogen levels in the malt will affect the beer’s color. Regular inspection of nitrogen levels is a positive step in ensuring color consistency in beer.

Foam stability is an important aesthetic and textural component of beer that is influenced by the malt selection. Malt contains many foam promoting proteins such as LTP1 and protein Z. Different varieties of barley and grain have varying levels of these foam-promoting proteins. Factors such as the environment it was grown in and the harvest season has a significant impact on their concentrations.

It is advisable to not drastically change the source of the raw ingredients that make up the malt bill during a production run of a particular beer. High levels of heat treatment during kilning will denature many of the proteins involved in foam creation and stability. Therefore the darker color of malt used, the less stable the foam will be in the finished product. There are also several active enzymes on malts that do not undergo a large degree of kilning. Malt lipoxygenase is an enzyme that will lead to a reduction in foam stability. If there is a serious problem in foam stability, lipoxygenase could be a contributing factor, in which case it would be advisable to select malts with low levels of this enzyme.

Beer clarity and haze formation are potential problems during production. The malt bill is one source of this problem. Barley with high levels of nitrogen can result in haze formation problems due to high levels of haze precursors. The addition of wheat can significantly help to reduce haze issues that result from the malt bill because it is a husk-less grain and contains considerably fewer polyphenols (tannins).

The malt bill can potentially be a major source of microbiological contaminants that lead to major defects in beer, most noticeably in taste and gushing. Harmful fungi and bacteria can reside within the barley and grain in the malt. They can release harmful and/or distasteful substances such as lactic acid, acetic acid, and mycotoxins. They are also the primary cause of beer gushing, or the uncontrollable release of dissolved gases in the container - resulting in overflowing foam. The simplest prevention method is to avoid the use of potentially contaminated grain.

Additional precautions can also be taken to clean the grain that makes up the malt bill. Chemical methods can be employed to combat microbial contaminants such as ozone exposure and hydrogen peroxide treatment. Ensuring a clean malt bill is critical in preventing the production of mycotoxins from biological foreign contaminants.

When grinding the malt, it is best to do so in a separate space, away from the brewing equipment. Grinding grain can be a messy process and potentially contaminated grain dust can easily spread throughout the whole brewery.

#### Recommendations
- Calculate the diastatic power of the malt

- Think in terms of color, flavor, foam stability, and additions when choosing a blend

- Taste the individual dry malts

- Monitor the nitrogen content of the malt bill

- Inspect the grains and consider treatment if microbiological contamination is a concern

- Grinding should take place away from the brewing equipment
