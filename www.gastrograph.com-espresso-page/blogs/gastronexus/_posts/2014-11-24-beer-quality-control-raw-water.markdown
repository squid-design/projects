#### Water pH
Water directly affects the flavor, mouth feel, and appearance of beer. It also influences other processes during brewing. Water quality can directly affect the color, foam stability, and colloidal stability of the finished product. The pH of the water used has significant implications on the chemistry that occurs during brewing and should be regularly measured throughout the brewing process. Other water quality factors, such as dissolved solutes and metal ion concentrations also have a profound impact on the finished product. At the very least, the water used to make beer should taste good on it’s own. You can’t make good beer, if you have bad water!

The pH scale is ultimately a measure of hydronium ion concentration. The pH scale ranges from 0-14 and directly influences the chemistry of the brewing process. For example, pH and alpha-acid isomerization are directly proportional: the higher the pH, the faster the rate of alpha-acid isomerization. Therefore high-alkaline mash water will result in an unpleasantly coarse and bitter beer.

High alkaline (basic) water greatly affects Maillard browning reactions that take place in the malt. It accelerates the browning reactions, which give the beer both color and flavor compounds. Alkaline water also speeds up the caramelization reactions that take place during production. Alternatively, acidic water will help precipitate polyphenols, which will help remove haze-causing precursors.

#### Tuning pH
There are several courses of action that can be taken in the adjustment of the pH. Distilled water can help neutralize the pH of the solution in the mash, which is especially useful in reducing the alkalinity of the mash. Grain additions and specialty malts can also greatly influence the pH of the mash. Salts dosed in the proper amount can be used to tune the pH of the water being used for the mash, which will later make up the beer.

It is advised to record the initial pH of the water used for the mash and to track the pH changes of the beer throughout the brewing process to ensure consistency. pH value records can be a valuable tool in assessing potential inconsistencies between production runs. An optimal target pH range of the mash is between 5.1-5.5. This is the pH range where desirable enzymes work the most efficiently and lead to the greatest release of desirable fermentable sugars.

Mash that is too acidic will favor proteolytic enzymes, thereby degrading critical proteins and releasing amino acids. Mash that is too alkaline will increase the extraction of polyphenols (tannins) and greatly disfavor enzymes that breakdown starch to fermentable sugars. Alkaline mash will also favor maltase, which is and enzyme that convert maltose to glucose. Mash and wort with high concentrations of glucose can cause significant problems during fermentation and often result in incomplete fermentations.

#### Dissolved Solutes in Brewing Water
The dissolved solute makeup of the water does not only influence the pH, but can also contribute to the overall taste of the beer, as well as the foaming properties of the beer. The inclusion of cations, such as zinc, has proven to greatly improve foam stability.

  Water filtration is an extremely important measure of ensuring water quality. Microbiological contamination is a serious threat in beer production. It can impart off-putting flavors and even release mycotoxins. While many of microbes will be killed during the beer making process, some can survive by forming endospores and becoming resistant to heat.


  It is advisable to filter water through a carbon filtration system or via reverse osmosis to reduce the risk of any microbial contaminants from the water supply. This will also result in better tasting water. Whenever utilizing reverse osmosis or water softening, it is critical to ensure adequate mineral concentration. Many brewers will often add additional salts to adjust particular ion concentrations.

  Common salts utilized in the brewing industry are: calcium sulfate (gypsum), magnesium sulfate (Epsom salt), calcium chloride, calcium carbonate (chalk), and calcium hydroxide (pickling lime).

\* Reverse osmosis (RO) is a water filtration process by which water passes through a semi-permeable membrane. While this results in almost pure water, certain ions can pass through at different rates. Smaller ions such as bicarbonate and sodium will pass through more easily than larger ions such as sulfate.

Regardless of water source or style of beer, there are certain trace compounds that are always undesirable in any concentration. These undesirable compounds include: iron, manganese, nitrite, nitrate, sulfide, fluoride, chlorine, chloramine, and heavy metals. These compounds should be minimized through water filtration. They mostly result in fermentation problems and/or are health hazards.

If tap or municipal water is used, as is so often the case, there are methods of removing chlorine and chloramine. One of the more simple methods of chlorine removal is boiling the water. This is time consuming, energy intensive, and only partially effective because it will only remove the chlorine and not the chloramine. Active carbon filtration is a fairly effective way of removing chlorine and chloramine, however it is fairly slow. There are two different chemical additions that can remove chlorine and chloramine, yielding harmless ions: metabisulfite and ascorbic acid both effectively eliminate chlorine and chloramine. See reaction below:

Water is the primary source of dissolved solutes found in beer. Dissolved salts can affect both the taste and chemistry of the beer. They can have a significant impact on yeast metabolism and can accelerate or dampen fermentation rates. The primary ions that most brewers closely monitor are: sulfate, sodium, chloride, magnesium, calcium, carbonate, and bicarbonate. These ions can greatly affect the palate sensations and flavors in beer. It is important to measure, record, and track water solute concentration to ensure a consistent product. As a general rule, it is best to try and mimic the water composition of the water supply at the place where that style of beer was first developed. Beers were originally developed to suit the local water supply, not the other way around. For example, Burton-on-Trent is a town in the UK that has local water with an unusually high concentration of sulfate.  Through decades of trial and error they discovered that highly hopped beers are particularly well-suited for their local water. Now, Burton is famous for its highly hopped ales.

#### Common Ions and Their Properties
*Sulfates* play a major role in accentuating the “hoppiness” of beer. It helps to bring a sharp and bitter dryness to beer. Sulfates are considered a positive addition in most hop-heavy beers, but only in moderate concentrations. Ideal sulfate ranges are between 0-350 ppm, with the concentration no higher than 150 ppm for beers that are not highly hopped.

*Sodium*, like sulfates, can contribute positive flavors and mouth sensations when within the right concentrations. In low concentrations, sodium contributes to the body and mouth feel of beer. However, in higher concentrations it tastes salty and will bring out marine-like notes in a beer. Sodium concentrations should be between 0-150 ppm, but these concentrations are largely beer-dependent.

*Chloride* ions add pleasant mouth feel sensations and can contribute to the overall complexity of a beer. But in higher concentrations it can impart a medicinal-like taste to beer and is considered a flaw. Chloride should not exceed 100 ppm.

*Magnesium* ions are critical for yeast health and respiration. In the right concentrations they will ensure a successful fermentation, but in higher amounts magnesium leaves the mouth dry and sour, leaving an astringent aftertaste. Optimal magnesium levels are between 5-30 ppm.

*Carbonate* and *bicarbonate* ions greatly impact the pH of the water used in beer. The pH can often be tuned by manipulating these ion concentrations.

*Calcium* mostly contributes to the overall permanent hardness of the water used in a beer. It is also a critical yeast nutrient and plays a pivotal role in the precipitation of certain proteins during wort boiling. By ensuring adequate calcium levels, it will help ensure a complete fermentation and help remove haze-causing proteins. The ideal calcium concentration is between 50-100 ppm, however these values largely depend on the beer. Lagers, for example, require much less calcium than other beers.

#### Residual Alkalinity
Dissolved solutes have significant impact on the overall chemistry of beer. In the 1950s, the residual alkalinity (RA) scale was developed by Paul Kohlbach. The RA scale expresses the interaction between water hardness and alkalinity. Calculating this value is useful in understanding mashing chemistry and performance. To increase alkalinity, add chalk or sodium bicarbonate to the mash. To decrease alkalinity, add acid to the mash. To harden the water add calcium or magnesium compounds. The additions of salts to adjust alkalinity, hardness, and likewise RA should be done on a beer-by-beer basis. As a general rule, darker beers require mashes with higher RAs and lighter beers require RAs with lower RAs.

#### Recommendations
- Closely monitor the pH of the water used before and during the brewing process with a pH-meter

- Ensure that the water being used tastes good itself. Bad water will make bad beer. Beware of tap water!

- Consider utilizing salts to adjust the pH and to aid in foam stabilization

- Take notice of dissolved solutes in the water used for brewing and closely track ion concentrations

- Filter your water and restore dissolved solutes to concentrations suitable to the style of beer being produced
