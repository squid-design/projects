Once you have chosen your objectives, tests, and panelists, those employees must be trained and calibrated on your product (or similar products). Training and calibration is a key step in generating reliable metrics for your quality control program. Without training and calibration, your panelists will create or guess at their own standards of references, notes, and intensities – severely crippling your program's ability to detect flaws, taints, contaminations, and batch deviations.

Calibration is a time and resources intensive stage of running a quality control program. To calibrate your employees’ palates you will need to:

1. Select the important flavor attributes to measure in your product [(discussed in Part 2)][part-2]
2. Select pure samples of the selected flavors (for example: pine needles or dried plums) at a consistent concentration
3. Have your panelists smell and taste the pure samples
4. Agree on a set of descriptive terms and intensity scores for each attribute of each pure sample

The best quality control programs use spike kits to train their panelists to identify common flaws, taints, and contaminations in their products. Spike kits can be used to increase your panelists’ sensitivities and knowledge of the common flaws and contaminations that can appear in your products. Spike kits will also help your team develop a common vocabulary and vigilance for each flaw causing compound. Calibration training should be revisited every 3 – 6 months to stop panel drift and to train new panelists.

If possible, your company should create a library of reference flavors at their selected concentration available for your panelists to taste, smell, and sample. Common ‘library’ entries include the range of raw ingredients for your products, as well as standard kitchen spices, dried fruits, botanical extracts, dried flowers, or aroma vials. Keeping your flavor library open after training your panel will help reduce panel drift and increase the consistency of your panelists’ reviews.

It is often best to start the training program with a product that your company does not produce, such as coffee for a beer brewery or beer for a coffee roaster; this allows all of your panelists to take a fresh and objective stance, and not worry about how their initial assessment of your products will be received.

> A quality control team should never be incentivized or penalized for finding or missing flaws, taints, contaminations, or batch deviations in your product.

Top quality control teams operate independently, and do not need to hide information about detected flaws or variations from the rest of the company. Easy and fearless communication of findings is a top priority for protecting and growing your brand.

After calibrating your panel on other products, you should create a series of baseline reviews for each of your products that panelists will be reviewing – ideally for every product you produce.  To set a baseline, your panelists should review each product individually, and those reviews should be discussed until agreement is reached on a common standard of vocabulary, references, intensities, and protocols for reviewing products. Agreement does not need to be unanimous, as individual panelists may be in different tasting populations and preference archetypes.  Diversity is a strong advantage to a quality control team.

The best quality control programs will test panelists' abilities to identify flaws, taints, and contaminations by adding spiked or stale products to panels. The more times the group of panelists is able to accurately flag a product as flawed in your blind tests, the more likely they will find and triage it during quality control reviews.

Having a set of experienced and trained tasters in your company will help with new product development, spotting market opportunities, and getting your product into new distribution channels and partners such as bars and restaurants, as well as their role in quality control.  Cultivating these experienced tasters is one of the goals of training, calibrating, and re-calibrating your entire sensory team, and giving them the tools they need to learn and succeed.

The steps to a top quality panelist training program are:

1. Train the panelists on products outside of your scope, such as coffee for a beer producer (or vice versa) – get them comfortable talking about flavor and critiquing products
2. Train the panelists on products outside of your scope, such as coffee for a beer producer (or vice versa) – get them comfortable talking about flavor and critiquing products
3. Calibrate your panel – set a standard for descriptions, intensities, and references
4. Use flaw or spike kits to train your panelists to recognize specific flaws or contaminations
5. Have monthly check-ins to make sure your panelists are not drifting in their sensitivities or references

###Our method:
From the first few reviews of each panelist, the Gastrograph System's machine learning and data science models learns to control for individual reviewer experience, sensitivities to each flavor-attribute, and demographic tasting population. Our machine learning models are able, to detect flaws, taints,  contaminations, based on how each individual reviewer responds to changes to the flavor of your product, while controlling for environmental differences.  Our models remove the subjectivity surrounding your reviewer’s assessment by monitoring all of their reviews and building a model for their individual tastes and preferences.

Gastrograph Review for [Android][android] and [iOS][ios] has built-in employee training, which automatically adapts and adjusts its content for the sensitivity and experience of each member of your quality control panel. Our integrated employee training will help train and calibrate your panel on select reviews of your product (without degrading your data); we help guide your employees in identifying specific tasting notes, reference flavor, and potential flaw compounds – helping you start, build, and scale an actionable quality control program. You can [learn to use the app here][how-to-review].

Finally, our [machine learning algorithms and data models][whitepapers] are capable of flagging flaws that haven’t even appeared yet, regardless of whether your panelists have detected it. It’s because our algorithms have been trained to pick out the flavor signatures of each potential quality control problem that can appear in your product just from the sensory data of your panel.  This lets you trust in the results of your quality control tests even when a new or less experienced reviewer is on the panel for a certain product or batch.
