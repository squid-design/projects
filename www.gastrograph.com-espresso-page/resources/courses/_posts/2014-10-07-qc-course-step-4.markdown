The best quality control programs schedule their tests with enough time to stop or delay the release of a batch when quality control problems are found. Developing a consistent pre-release review schedule that leaves enough time for you to change your distribution plan is an important component of a successful quality control program, and is what will protect your brand from losing clients in the long run.

> A quality control program is only useful if it allows you to stop a batch with a noticeable variation, flaw, or contamination from getting into your consumers hands and onto their taste buds.

The craft and artisan market is becoming increasingly competitive. There are more brands with higher quality products than ever before. Your current and potential customers are more educated, more experienced, and more open to unique and diverse flavor profiles – giving you precious few chances to convert a new consumer into a brand loyalist.

Once established, your brand loyalists will continue purchasing your product as long as you maintain consistency batch-to-batch and they never receive a flawed, tainted, or contaminated product – **Consumers will always blame your product before their palate, cup, or preparation.** Thus, an effective quality control program that can pull batches before distribution gives your company the maximum level of protection.

In order to create a quality control program with the ability to pull deviant products before distribution, you need to:

1. Obtain buy in from the owner, head of production, and your team.
2. Set a review schedule in which new products are reviewed at specific points in the production process and on the day of completion.
3. Always pad your production schedule with enough time and capacity to remake a batch of flawed product.
4. Be willing to lose a batch worth of sales in the short run to protect your brand for the long run.

The best quality control programs include reviews of each product at intermediary stages of production. Selecting stages where it is possible to taste and review the raw ingredients of the unfinished product&mdash;for example, the mash in distilled products or the wort of unfinished beer. Similarly, sample roasting can often reveal potential flaws in the green coffee. Reviewing your products on these intermediary stages will give you and your team the data and knowledge to make batch decisions before it costs you time and money.

As discussed in [Part 3][part-3], your quality control team will need to generate enough reviews for statistical significance in each test, and each of those tests will take time to analyze. Each additional stage of production that you take a deviant product through will cost your company time and resources. The earlier you catch the flaw or deviation, the more likely you can take corrective action, and the more time you have to re-run or reschedule the release of the batch. Alternatively, it is better to run fewer tests with more panelists with more time for analysis verses stressing your resources and team. Only run the number of tests you and your team can handle.

Many quality control problems develop under times of increasing production, limited editions, and seasonal releases – the worst possible times to have flaws, taints, or deviations in your product! Your review schedule should scale with production and keep pace with your busiest time of year.

> Not running your quality control program during expansions, the holidays, and for seasonal releases or limited editions is a mistake waiting to destroy your brand.

Finally, having the foresight to forgo shipping a deviant batch is the hallmark of an effective quality control program.  This requires buy-in from the production team and management, trust in your tests and results, and the assurance that the short term loss of product and revenue will be more than offset by the growth and profit that the best quality control programs build in the long run.

###Our method:
The Gastrograph Review app allows your team to review at their convenience – at various stages of production and before every batch is shipped. The Gastrograph System runs thousands of tests on each of your products at each stage of production (which you and your team review). Using Gastrograph, you don’t need to worry about selecting tests, statistical significance, or interpreting the results. The Gastrograph System automates the most difficult part of your quality control program, giving you the information and insight that you need to ship the best batch every time.

> [The Gastrograph System][science] monitors your products in real time 24 hours a day, 365 days a year, by analyzing thousands of variables from your panelists' reviews and other local, regional, and global conditions.

The Gastrograph System can link and monitor the flavor profile of your products at intermediate stages of production and show you how changes in the unfinished product will affect the final flavor profile of the batch and predict if it contains flaws, taints, or deviations.
