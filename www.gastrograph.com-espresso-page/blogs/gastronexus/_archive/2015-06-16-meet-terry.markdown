**What type of work do you do for Gastrograph?**

I seek out patterns hidden among flavor data and derive insights from them.

**What sparked your interest in working in that field?**

My love of exploring data and my passion toward improving quality control.

**Why did you choose AFS?**

The problems/projects are challenging and innovative. Everyone knows each other well through all kinds of team activities, helps each other to figure out the solution when encountering difficulties, and is full of passion and energy.

**Gastrograph has a pretty unique environment. What would you say your favorite part is?**

Definitely mixed martial arts (MMA) lessons. It indeed hurts every time, but afterwards I feel so relaxed and energized.

**You get to evaluate many different drinks. What product is your favorite to taste test?**

Rwanda-Lake Kivu coffee by French Truck in New Orleans. Our internal recommendation engine says that this is my favorite out of all my historical coffee reviews.

**Working at a startup can be time consuming. What activities do you do in your free time to alleviate the stress?**

Running, hiking, BBQ, karaoke, and very recently mixed martial arts with the other AFS employees.

**What would you choose as your last meal?**

The whole steak in a steak-eating contest, including my competitor's.

**Who would win in a battle between a ninja and a pirate?**

The ninja, because ninja turtles can outswim any pirate.
