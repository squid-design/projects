The raw ingredients to make beer have been selected to give desired qualities to the finished brew (hopefully using the tips in earlier posts).  These raw ingredients now have to be combined, brewed and packaged.  Even with your selection of premium ingredients it is possible to get inconsistent and/or substandard results if the brewing process is not carefully controlled.

There are three major criteria in which careful monitoring and control are very important: temperature, pH, and oxidation.   These conditions are important because they can change the flavor active compounds present in the brew (both good and bad) and they can change concentrations and configurations of compounds that affect the foam stability, clarity, and other qualities of beer.

This series will discuss various ways to improve quality control.  Part 1 will discuss the importance of temperature control.  Part 2 will discuss pH control and monitoring.  Part 3 will discuss oxygen and oxidation as it relates to brewing.

Beer is a simple thing to make but something that is difficult to perfect.  These tips should allow for you to bring your brewing practices closer to perfection and the consistency of the finished product.
