**What type of work do you do for Gastrograph?**

I am responsible for the look-and-feel of everything Gastrograph. From the Android app to our website, I work to ensure that every part of Gastrograph looks great and is easy to use.

**What sparked your interest in working in that field?**

Just an appreciation for good design, I think. I've always been interested in objects that are easy and enjoyable to use.

**Why did you choose AFS?**

I work for AFS because I want to see what beverage producers can make with sensory analytics on their side.

**Gastrograph has a pretty unique environment. What would you say your favorite part is?**

My favorite part is the amount of delicious food and drink that circulates through our hacker house. As a team, we're constantly encouraging each other to try new things.

**You get to evaluate many different drinks. What product is your favorite to taste test?**

I like tasting beer a lot. The most interesting beers to me are creative takes on traditional and time-tested recipes.

**Working at a startup can be time consuming. What activities do you do in your free time to alleviate the stress?**

I spend quite a bit of time listening to music. Right now I'm going through the early Delta blues classics - John Lee Hooker, Muddy Waters, Skip James, Son House...

**If you were a character from Star Wars, which one would you be?**

I'd definitely *want* to be Lando. That guy is so stylish and always knows what to say. Did I mention he can dance?

Some might question his decision to sell out his best friend to the Empire. To that, I'd argue that he saved his entire city (maybe planet) at the cost of Han and *then* saved him in return.

I probably *would* be Wedge.
