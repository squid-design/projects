**What type of work do you do for Gastrograph?**

My work revolves around data: somewhere in-between machine learning and UX, involved for instance both in bettering the data collection experience, and in algorithm-tweaking for appropriate analysis.

**What sparked your interest in working in that field?**

I like to use data to tell stories – perhaps because of my Cognitive Science background, I find myself instinctively drawn to the human aspect surrounding each data point. Algorithms and data science allow me to bring these stories together, and follow their interactions on a large scale.

**Why did you choose AFS?**

A side effect of working with data is that you get to learn the nitty-gritty of the field your data is from – AFS combined my passion for data, and that for artisan foods and drinks.
I also appreciated the different approach I found here. There is often almost a synonymy between tech and disruption in many discourses today. The focus at AFS is rather aligned towards enhancing that which already exists: on working with and not against traditional practices to achieve better, perhaps even previously unthought-of results.

**Gastrograph has a pretty unique environment. What would you say your favorite part is?**

The fact that the work is very research-oriented: more than working a deadline, there is attention and care given to framing and exploring questions that might not have been previously tackled. And – after translating all this into code – that you get a taste (pun perhaps intended) of the real-world, tangible impact that good software, good algorithms, good research can have.

**You get to evaluate many different drinks. What product is your favorite to taste test?**

I’m not (yet?) a professional taster like many of my colleagues – so simply the act of evaluation, of training myself to distinguish and assessing different flavors is really interesting to me. I think my favorite so far have been the beer tastings; I had a big passion for coffee and wine even before joining AFS, so I was more used to different varieties and subtleties of the two. However, I’ve tried such a greater variety of beers while here compared to what I’ve been previously exposed to - after saying ‘This does not taste like beer’ so many times, it became very clear how narrow my initial assessment of the drink was. It’s truly remarkable what can result from experimenting with flavor!

**Working at a startup can be time consuming. What activities do you do in your free time to alleviate the stress?**

I’m a huge film and theater buff; I also try to travel as much as I can – bookstore and gallery hopping are always fun ways of getting to know a place.

**Who would win a battle between a ninja and a pirate?**

I’m gonna play the I’m-from-Romania card and say the vampire. Because immortality, so.
