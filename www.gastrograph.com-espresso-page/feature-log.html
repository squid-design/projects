            <li>Redesigned product info to include more relevant pieces of metadata. No longer will you be stuck with incomplete knowledge of the parameters of your tasting.</li>
            <li>You will now be notified when you are invited to a panel set. The first notification will tell you a panel has been scheduled about 2 hours before the tasting, and the second notification will be 15 minutes before the tasting. Now there's no excuse to be late or miss the panel.</li>
            <li>We also include how much time the panel is expected to take in the notification, so there's no excuse to leave in the middle of a tasting.</li>
            <li>All of these notifications is the reason behind the five new permissions this app requests.</li>

            <ul><u class="log-feature">New features in 4.9.7<i>Jul 29, 2015, 4:14:48 PM:</i></u>
            <li>Panel Sets!!! Now you can schedule and start a set of reviews for a single tasting from your Producer Panel. Each of your panelists will be able to join the panel set and have all of the products and meta-data right there and ready to go. Panelists join a panel set by entering a PIN from Gastrograph Review for iOS and Android.</li>
            <li>The new panel set feature allows you to create and share blind sets - this is super useful for hiding identifying information, training your panelists, or slipping them other peoples products to test their knowledge. See how much or how little they know!</li>
            </ul>
            <ul><u class="log-fix">Bug Fixes in 4.9.62 <i>Jul 2, 2015, 1:55:01 PM:</i></u>
            <li>Fixed issue where whitespace at the end of usernames and emails didn't allow sign-in and registration. Sorry!</li>
            <li>After a review, swipe up on your graph to view detailed metrics on the review's similarity to the objective flavor profile and batch-to-batch variation. Now you can see how similar your perception is to the average reviewer of average skill! Gastrograph review will also tell you if your review is indicative of a batch-to-batch deviation so you can call for reinforcements.</li>
            <li>Also, we moved notes to the back of the OFP card - you will find all of your notes and and reference flavors there.</li>
            <li>After a review, swipe up or down on your OFP tab to see your other teammate's reviews. This helps you keep tabs on your teammates perception. Trust no one. </li>
        </ul>

            <li>Bug fixes for registration and user profiles - a few people couldn't sign in because the Android keyboard inserted a white space after their email. This was a really annoying bug. We now fixed this on our side so you can review in peace. Sorry!</li>

            <li>Performance improvement - we're serious about app preformance on older devices. Ask us about our user testing.</li>
